## Visual Observations

### User Interface
- **Layout & Design**:
  - 

- **User Experience**:
  - better loading but it still stops at 90% for the chunking text. make it so the chunking_text while loop adds a percentage to the overall progress like you did for the processing page step
  - security warning given to user - this shouldn't be the case since I have access to the console and backend output. if anything is presented to the user, make it a failure code so it is concealed
