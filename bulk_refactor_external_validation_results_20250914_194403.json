This means your coverage would no longer be active. To avoid this, it's important to make sure your payments are made on time each month.\n\nIf you're having trouble making a payment, I'd encourage you to reach out to your insurance company right away. They may be able to work with you on a payment plan or other options to keep your coverage in place.
