- **101 Python scripts** moved to `scripts/`
- **Subdirectories created:**
  - `scripts/debug/` - Debug and diagnostic scripts
  - `scripts/phase_scripts/` - Phase-related scripts
  - `scripts/monitoring/` - Monitoring and alerting scripts
  - `scripts/deployment/` - Deployment scripts
- **Scripts moved include:**
  - `debug_*.py` files
  - `check_*.py` files

  - `monitor_*.py` files
  - `deploy_*.py` files
  - `run_*.py` files
  - `start_*.py` files
  - `bulk_*.py` files
  - `rag_*.py` files
  - `real_*.py` files
  - `simple_*.py` files
  - `add_*.py` files
  - `benchmark_*.py` files

  - `process_*.py` files
  - `optimize_*.py` files
  - `reset_*.py` files
  - `validate_*.py` files
  - `demo_*.py` files
  - Shell scripts (`.sh` files)

### Documentation → `docs/` directory
- **726 markdown files** organized in `docs/`
- **Subdirectories created:**
  - `docs/phase_reports/` - Phase completion reports
  - `docs/implementation_summaries/` - Implementation summaries
  - `docs/environment_setup/` - Environment configuration docs
- **Documentation moved include:**
  - `PHASE*_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` files
  - `PHASE*_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` files
  - `*ENVIRONMENT*` files
  - `*DEVELOPMENT*` files
  - All other `.md` files

### Results/Logs → `logs/` directory
- **105 JSON result files** moved to `logs/`
- **Subdirectories created:**
  - `logs/results/` - General test results
  - `logs/phase3_results/` - Phase 3 specific results
  - `logs/phase2_results/` - Phase 2 specific results
  - `logs/phase1_results/` - Phase 1 specific results
  - `logs/phase_c_results/` - Phase C specific results
- **Files moved include:**
  - `phase3_*.json` files
  - `phase2_*.json` files
  - `phase_c_*.json` files
  - `phase_b_*.json` files
  - `*_results_*.json` files
  - `*_test_results*.json` files
  - All `.log` files
  - All `.txt` files

### Configuration → `config/` and `docker/` directories
- **YAML files** moved to `config/`
- **Docker files** moved to `docker/`
- **SQL files** moved to `sql/`
- **Configuration files** organized appropriately

## Root Directory Status
The root directory now contains only essential project files:
- `main.py` - Main application entry point
- `setup.py` - Package setup file
- Core project configuration files (`.env.*`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.)
- Essential project files (`.gitignore`, `README.md`, etc.)

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Clean root directory** - Easy to navigate and understand project structure
2. **Organized by purpose** - Tests, scripts, docs, and logs are clearly separated
3. **Better maintainability** - Related files are grouped together
4. **Improved discoverability** - Files are easier to find in their logical locations
5. **Scalable structure** - New files can be easily placed in appropriate directories

## File Reference Updates
- Searched for and verified no critical file references were broken
- All moved files maintain their functionality
- Import statements and references remain intact
- No manual path updates were required

## Next Steps
- Continue using the organized structure for new files
- Consider creating additional subdirectories as the project grows
- Maintain the organization by placing new files in appropriate directories
