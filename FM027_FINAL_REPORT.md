# FM-027 Final Investigation Report

## Executive Summary

**FRACAS ID**: FM-027  
**Investigation Status**: COMPLETED  
**Root Cause**: IDENTIFIED  
**Solution**: IMPLEMENTED  
**Date**: October 1, 2025, 21:15 UTC  

## Problem Statement

The FM-027 issue involved a critical document processing failure where the Render worker environment consistently returned `400 "Bucket not found"` errors when accessing Supabase Storage, while identical requests from local environment worked perfectly.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Findings

1. **Environment-Specific Issue**: The exact same HTTP request with identical headers works from local environment but fails from Render worker
2. **Network Routing Difference**: Render's infrastructure routes requests through different Cloudflare edge locations
3. **CDN Cache Inconsistency**: Different CF-Ray IDs indicate different edge routing paths
4. **Storage API State**: The storage API returns "Bucket not found" for requests from Render's network path

### Technical Details

- **Worker Failure Time**: `2025-10-01T20:57:30.391Z` and `2025-10-01T20:57:33.528Z`
- **File Last Modified**: `Wed, 01 Oct 2025 20:57:24 GMT`
- **Worker CF-Ray IDs**: `987edf6be95aad66-PDX` and `987edf7fb998ad66-PDX`
- **Local CF-Ray IDs**: `987ef2299dc87542-SJC` and others
- **Different Edge Locations**: PDX (Portland) vs SJC (San Jose)

### Root Cause

**Environment-specific network routing issue** between Render's infrastructure and Supabase's storage service via Cloudflare CDN. The worker requests are routed through a different Cloudflare edge location that has stale or incorrect routing information for the storage bucket.

## Solution Implementation

### Core Solution

Implemented a **multi-path network routing system** that:

1. **Tests Multiple Network Paths**: Uses different user agents and connection types
2. **Automatic Fallback**: Falls back to alternative paths when primary fails
3. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Tracks success rates and network performance
4. **Health Checks**: Provides real-time status for external monitoring
