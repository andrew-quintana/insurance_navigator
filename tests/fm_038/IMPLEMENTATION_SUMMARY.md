## Test Queries Explained

### Why These Specific Queries?

#### Query 1: "What mental health services are covered under my insurance plan?"
- **Coverage Area:** Mental health benefits
- **Query Type:** Service coverage inquiry
- **Expected Data:** Chunks about mental health coverage, therapy, counseling
- **RAG Test:** Tests retrieval of healthcare benefit information

#### Query 2: "Does my policy cover ambulance services?"
- **Coverage Area:** Emergency services
- **Query Type:** Yes/no coverage question
- **Expected Data:** Chunks about ambulance/emergency transportation
- **RAG Test:** Tests specific coverage item retrieval

#### Query 3: "What are the copay requirements for primary care visits?"
- **Coverage Area:** Cost sharing
- **Query Type:** Financial information
- **Expected Data:** Chunks about copay amounts, cost structure
- **RAG Test:** Tests numerical/financial data retrieval

### Query Selection Rationale
1. ✅ **Representative:** Cover common user question patterns
2. ✅ **Diverse:** Test different coverage areas and question types
3. ✅ **Realistic:** Based on actual user queries
4. ✅ **Verifiable:** Test document contains relevant information
5. ✅ **Diagnostic:** Help identify specific retrieval issues

## Investigation Focus

### What This Script Investigates

#### 1. Authentication Flow ✅
- Login process and JWT token generation
- Token validation and user data retrieval
- Session management
- Authentication error handling

#### 2. Request Processing ✅
- Chat endpoint handling
- Request validation and parsing
- Header management
- Response processing

#### 3. Function Analysis ✅
- Input parameter logging (types and values)
- Output capture and validation
- Execution timing
- Error detection

#### 4. Performance Monitoring ✅
- Request duration tracking
- Function execution timing
- Bottleneck identification
- Resource usage patterns

#### 5. Error Detection ✅
- Exception catching and logging
- Silent failure identification
- Timeout detection
- Network issue monitoring

### What Requires Production Log Analysis

The script provides complete **client-side visibility**, but for **server-side RAG operations**, you must check production logs for:

- `RAG Operation Started [uuid]` - Operation initiation
- `RAG Operation SUCCESS/FAILED` - Operation completion
- `CHECKPOINT A-H` - Internal RAG flow checkpoints
- `PRE-EMBEDDING` / `POST-EMBEDDING` - Embedding generation
- `Chunks:X/Y` - Chunk retrieval counts

**Why?** These are server-side operations that occur after the API receives the request. The script can't monitor internal server operations, only the client-server interaction.
