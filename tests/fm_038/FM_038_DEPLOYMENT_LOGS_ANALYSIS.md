# FM-038: Deployment Logs Analysis - Why No Intermediate Logs?

## üîç **Question**: Why were we able to see intermediate logs before but not now?

## üìä **Deployment Timeline Analysis**

### **Recent Deployments**
```
dep-d3jk753ipnbc739q2h8g - 05:09:41 (LIVE) - Fix double logging
dep-d3jk0oqdbo4c73fcesog - 04:56:04 - PRE-EMBEDDING checkpoints  
dep-d3jjmvruibrs73e61260 - 04:35:12 - Threading fix (PR #14)
dep-d3jjgd7gi27c73eh1n1g - 04:21:09 - Coroutine fix
```

### **Critical Finding: Deployment DID Happen But Logs Still Missing**

**Evidence from Production Logs:**
```
04:39:15 - RAG Operation Started (instance: xbcw7)
04:39:16 - RAG Operation SUCCESS - 0 chunks

04:41:50 - RAG Operation Started (instance: xbcw7)
[deployment rolls out]
04:42:32 - "Detected service running on port 10000" <- NEW DEPLOYMENT!
[continued execution on same instance]
04:43:48 - Chat processing timed out (instance: xbcw7)
```

**The smoking gun**: The RAG operation that started at `04:41:50` was STILL RUNNING when the new deployment rolled out at `04:42:32`, and it timed out at `04:43:48` - **WITHOUT any HEARTBEAT or PRE-EMBEDDING logs!**

## üéØ **Root Cause: It's NOT A Deployment Issue!**

### **What We Know**
1. ‚úÖ Code IS deployed (multiple deployments confirmed)
2. ‚úÖ Build filter includes `agents/**` (confirmed in service config)
3. ‚ùå **NO diagnostic logs appearing** despite code being deployed
4. ‚ùå **NO HEARTBEAT logs** even after multiple deployments

### **The Real Problem: Logs Are Never Reaching That Code Path**

Looking at the successful completions:
- `04:39:16` - SUCCESS in **1.1 seconds** - 0 chunks
- `05:04:54` - SUCCESS in **4.2 seconds** - 0 chunks  
- `05:06:44` - SUCCESS in **1.7 seconds** - 0 chunks
- `05:07:22` - SUCCESS in **0.7 seconds** - 0 chunks

**Pattern**: All successful requests complete in **under 5 seconds** with **0 chunks**.

**Failing request**:
- `04:41:50` - TIMEOUT after **118 seconds**

## üî¨ **Deep Analysis: Two Different Code Paths**

### **Code Path A: Fast Success (0-5 seconds)**
```python
# Performance monitoring starts
operation_metrics = self.performance_monitor.start_operation(...)
# ‚úÖ Logs: "RAG Operation Started"

# Something happens here that returns 0 chunks QUICKLY
# WITHOUT calling _generate_embedding()

# ‚úÖ Logs: "RAG Operation SUCCESS - 0 chunks"
```

**Why no HEARTBEAT logs?**
‚Üí Because `_generate_embedding()` is **never called** when there are 0 documents!

### **Code Path B: Slow Hang (118+ seconds)**  
```python
# Performance monitoring starts
operation_metrics = self.performance_monitor.start_operation(...)
# ‚úÖ Logs: "RAG Operation Started"

# Something happens that SHOULD call _generate_embedding()
# But hangs BEFORE reaching our PRE-EMBEDDING checkpoint

# ‚ùå Never logs: "PRE-EMBEDDING: About to call _generate_embedding..."
# ‚ùå Never logs: "HEARTBEAT 1-20"
# ‚ùå Times out after 120 seconds
```

**Why no HEARTBEAT logs?**
‚Üí Code hangs BEFORE reaching the `PRE-EMBEDDING` checkpoint at line 241!

## üìã **The Missing Piece: What's Between Line 237 and 241?**

```python
# Line 231-237: Performance monitor
operation_metrics = self.performance_monitor.start_operation(...)
# ‚úÖ WE SEE THIS LOG

# Line 239: Try block starts
try:
    # Line 241: PRE-EMBEDDING checkpoint
    self.logger.info("PRE-EMBEDDING: About to call...")  # ‚ùå NEVER REACHES HERE
```

**Something between line 237 and 241 is causing the hang!**

## üéØ **Why We NEVER Saw Intermediate Logs**

**Answer**: We've NEVER actually seen the HEARTBEAT or PRE-EMBEDDING logs in production!

**Evidence**:
1. Searched logs from `04:35:00 - 04:45:00` (deployment period)
2. Searched for "CHECKPOINT", "HEARTBEAT", "PRE-EMBEDDING"
3. **Result**: 0 matches

**Conclusion**: The hanging requests are failing BEFORE our diagnostic code executes!

## üîç **What Could Cause This?**

### **Hypothesis 1: Empty try Block Issue**
Python's `try:` statement itself doesn't cause hangs.

### **Hypothesis 2: Logger Blocking**
The logger itself might be blocking, but we see OTHER logs working fine.

### **Hypothesis 3: Something in Performance Monitor**
The `start_operation()` method might be doing something asynchronous that's not completing.

### **Hypothesis 4: Async Context Corruption**
The async/await context might be corrupted, preventing further code execution.

### **Hypothesis 5: The 0 Chunks Path Skips Embedding Generation**
**THIS IS THE MOST LIKELY!**

Looking at the `retrieve_chunks_from_text` code:
```python
async def retrieve_chunks_from_text(self, query_text: str):
    # Start monitoring
    operation_metrics = self.performance_monitor.start_operation(...)
    
    try:
        # This line should log
        self.logger.info("PRE-EMBEDDING: About to call...")
        
        # Generate embedding
        query_embedding = await self._generate_embedding(query_text)
```

**But what if there's a DIFFERENT code path that's being taken?**

Let me check if there's an early return or exception handler...

## üö® **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**

**The successful requests (0 chunks, fast completion) might be:**
1. Hitting an early return we don't see
2. Throwing an exception that's caught silently
3. Taking a completely different code path

**The hanging requests (timeout, slow) might be:**
1. Getting stuck in async/await deadlock
2. Blocking on some resource
3. Hanging in performance monitoring code

## üìä **Comparison: Before vs Now**

**Question**: "Why were we able to see intermediate logs before?"

**Answer**: **We NEVER saw intermediate logs!**

All our deployments show the same pattern:
- ‚úÖ "RAG Operation Started" (always appears)
- ‚ùå "PRE-EMBEDDING" (never appears)
- ‚ùå "HEARTBEAT 1-20" (never appears)
- ‚úÖ "RAG Operation SUCCESS" or timeout (always appears)

## üéØ **Next Steps to Investigate**

### **1. Check if _generate_embedding is Actually Being Called**
Add logging BEFORE the try block:
```python
async def retrieve_chunks_from_text(self, query_text: str):
    self.logger.info("CRITICAL: retrieve_chunks_from_text called")
    
    operation_metrics = self.performance_monitor.start_operation(...)
    self.logger.info("CRITICAL: After start_operation")
    
    try:
        self.logger.info("CRITICAL: Inside try block")
        self.logger.info("PRE-EMBEDDING: About to call...")
```

### **2. Check Performance Monitor Implementation**
The `start_operation()` method might be blocking or doing async work.

### **3. Check for Exception Handlers**
There might be a broad exception handler catching everything silently.

### **4. Check if 0 Chunks Means No Embedding Generation**
The system might skip embedding generation when there are no documents.

## üìã **Summary**

### **Why No Intermediate Logs?**

**Answer**: The code path that hangs NEVER REACHES the diagnostic logging!

### **Why 0 Chunks But Still Answers?**

**Answer**: System uses LLM fallback when RAG returns 0 chunks (NOT using user's documents)

### **What's Different Between Success and Failure?**

- **Success**: Fast path (0-5s), 0 chunks, skips embedding generation
- **Failure**: Slow path (118s), hangs before PRE-EMBEDDING checkpoint

### **Next Action**

Add logging BEFORE performance monitoring to identify exact hang point:
```python
self.logger.info("CHECKPOINT 1: Method entry")
operation_metrics = self.performance_monitor.start_operation(...)
self.logger.info("CHECKPOINT 2: After performance monitoring")
try:
    self.logger.info("CHECKPOINT 3: Inside try block")
```

**Investigation Date**: 2025-01-09  
**Finding**: Deployments working correctly, but diagnostic code never executes  
**Status**: üî¥ **ACTIVE - Need earlier checkpoints in code path**
