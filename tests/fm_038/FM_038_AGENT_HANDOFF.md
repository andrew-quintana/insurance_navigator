# FM-038: Agent Handoff - Zero Chunks Retrieved Investigation

**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Status:** üî¥ **CRITICAL - INVESTIGATION REQUIRED**  
**Priority:** P0 - Blocking all RAG functionality  
**Handoff From:** Previous AI Agent  
**Handoff To:** Next AI Agent

---

## Executive Summary

**Current Problem:** RAG operations are completing successfully but returning **0 chunks** in all cases, despite users having uploaded documents. This suggests either:
1. A fundamental issue with the chunk retrieval logic
2. Threading issues affecting database queries
3. Embedding generation silently failing
4. Database connection or query problems

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY (2025-01-27):** Database verification shows the user HAS data:
- ‚úÖ **1 document** (`scan_classic_hmo.pdf`)
- ‚úÖ **1138 chunks with embeddings**
- ‚úÖ **All chunks have embeddings** (1138/1138)
- ‚úÖ **Data is recent** (created 2025-10-08 22:14:30)

**Key Finding:** The zero-chunk issue is NOT due to missing data. The issue is in the **retrieval logic** - either embedding generation is failing silently, database queries aren't working correctly, or threading is interfering with async operations.

**Latest Production Evidence (2025-10-09 05:26:15 - 05:26:18):**
```
RAG Operation Started [f287de61-81be-4e4d-99a1-486e29849b1f]
RAG Operation SUCCESS - Duration:3140.0ms Chunks:0/0 Tokens:0
```

**Key Observation:** Operations complete in ~3 seconds (not hanging), but retrieve 0 chunks every time despite data existing in the database.

---

## Context You Need

### 1. What We've Been Working On
- **Original Issue**: RAG operations hanging indefinitely (120 seconds timeout)
- **Root Cause Theory**: OpenAI SDK network layer hangs when making embedding API calls
- **Threading Fix Applied**: Implemented 25-second timeout with synchronous OpenAI client
- **Current Status**: No longer hanging, BUT now returning 0 chunks

### 2. Key Files
- `agents/tooling/rag/core.py` - Main RAG implementation
  - `retrieve_chunks_from_text()` - Method being called by agents (line 216)
  - `_generate_embedding()` - Embedding generation with threading (line 269)
  - `retrieve_chunks()` - Database query for similar chunks (line 78)
- `agents/tooling/rag/observability.py` - Performance monitoring
- `tests/fm_038/` - All investigation documentation

### 3. Recent Changes
- **Commit `8ddd6afd`**: Added comprehensive checkpoint logging (CHECKPOINT A-H)
- **Commit `3c11a9fe`**: Fixed duplicate RAG logs with propagate=False
- **Commit `20d8dc57`**: Added PRE/POST-EMBEDDING checkpoints
- **Commit `274b16cd`**: Replaced AsyncOpenAI with synchronous OpenAI client

## The Problem: Zero Chunks Retrieved

### Evidence from Production Logs

**Request 1 (05:26:15):**
```
RAG Operation Started [f287de61-81be-4e4d-99a1-486e29849b1f]
user_id: cae3b3ec-b355-4509-bd4e-0f7da8cb2858
query_text: "To access mental health services..."
RAG Operation SUCCESS - Duration:3140.0ms Chunks:0/0 Tokens:0
```

**Request 2 (05:26:55):**
```
RAG Operation Started [d0e71573-eb15-43d3-885c-8b9cc520c3a1]

query_text: "Does the policy provide coverage for ambulance..."
[No completion log yet - may have started hanging again]
```

### Critical Questions to Answer

1. **Is embedding generation working?**
   - Are we successfully generating embeddings?
   - Are embeddings the correct dimension (1536)?
   - Are they valid float arrays?

2. **Is the database query working?**
   - Are there actually chunks in the database for this user?
   - Is the SQL query correct?
   - Are embeddings stored correctly in the database?

3. **Is the similarity threshold too high?**
   - Current threshold: 0.5
   - Are there chunks below threshold that would match?
   - What's the actual similarity distribution?

4. **Is threading interfering with database queries?**
   - Are async database queries working correctly?
   - Is the connection pool healthy?
   - Are queries timing out silently?

## What We Know Works

‚úÖ **Performance Monitoring**: `RAG Operation Started` logs appear correctly  
‚úÖ **Database Connection**: Service starts successfully, connection pool initialized  
‚úÖ **Fast Execution**: Operations complete in ~3 seconds (not hanging on all requests)

## Potential Root Causes (Ranked by Likelihood)

### 1. üî• **Embedding Generation Failing Silently** (MOST LIKELY)
- **Symptom**: No error logs, but embeddings might be invalid or not generated
- **Evidence For**: 
  - No CHECKPOINT logs appearing (may not reach embedding code)
  - Previous threading issues with OpenAI SDK
  - Could fail without raising exception
- **Check**: Add embedding validation logging, verify OpenAI API calls
- **Fix**: Ensure OpenAI API is returning valid embeddings, fix threading issues

### 2. üî• **Database Query Issues** (LIKELY)
- **Symptom**: Query not returning results despite data existing
- **Evidence For**: 
  - Recent threading changes might affect async queries
  - Vector search syntax could be incorrect
  - Async context might be disrupted
- **Check**: Log actual SQL being executed, check for asyncpg errors
- **Fix**: Debug SQL, check vector extension, verify indexes

### 3. üî• **Threading Affecting Database Queries** (LIKELY)
- **Symptom**: Async queries not working correctly in threaded context
- **Evidence For**: 
  - Threading added for embedding generation
  - Might affect async database connection context
  - Connection pool issues possible
- **Check**: Log thread information during queries, check connection pool
- **Fix**: Refactor to avoid threading or ensure proper async handling

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Vector Embedding Dimension Mismatch** (POSSIBLE)
- **Symptom**: Embeddings generated with wrong dimensions
- **Evidence For**: 
  - Could cause silent query failures
  - Model changes might affect dimensions
- **Evidence Against**: Would likely throw an error rather than return 0 results
- **Check**: Log embedding dimensions (should be 1536)
- **Fix**: Ensure correct model and dimension in queries

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Documents/Chunks for User** (RULED OUT) ‚ùå
- **Symptom**: Always returns 0 chunks
- **Evidence Against**: 
  - ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: User has 1 document (`scan_classic_hmo.pdf`)
  - ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: User has 1138 chunks with embeddings
  - ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: All chunks have embeddings (1138/1138)
  - ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: Data is recent (created 2025-10-08 22:14:30)
- **Database Verification Results:**
  ```
  Documents found: 1
  Chunks with embeddings: 1138
  Total chunks: 1138
  Chunks without embeddings: 0
  Document: scan_classic_hmo.pdf (1138 chunks, created 2025-10-08 22:14:30)
  ```
- **Conclusion**: This hypothesis is completely ruled out. The zero-chunk issue is NOT due to missing data.

### 6. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Similarity Threshold Too High** (POSSIBLE)
- **Symptom**: Chunks exist but don't meet 0.5 threshold
- **Evidence For**: 
  - Default threshold is 0.5 (relatively high)
  - Shows "0/0" (0 returned, 0 above threshold)
  - Would explain success with no results
- **Evidence Against**: 
  - Was working earlier when chunks were being pulled
  - Shows "0/0" suggesting no chunks at all, not just below threshold
  - System should show total_chunks_available > 0 if chunks exist
- **Check**: Query for similarity distribution, test with lower threshold
- **Fix**: Lower threshold or investigate embedding quality

## Previous Agent Notes

**What Worked:**
- Identified OpenAI SDK network hang as root cause of original timeout
- Added comprehensive checkpoint logging
- Fixed duplicate log entries (propagate=False)
- Documented complete timeline of changes
- Created detailed FRACAS report with investigation history

**What Didn't Work:**
- Threading timeout doesn't prevent underlying network hang
- AsyncOpenAI in threads caused TCP transport errors
- Synchronous client helped but didn't solve core issue
- Individual diagnostic approaches didn't reveal the full picture

**Current Theory:**
Either we're not successfully generating embeddings (and failing silently), OR we're generating embeddings but the database has no chunks to compare against, OR the similarity threshold is too high and filtering everything out. The comprehensive chat flow investigation will reveal which scenario is actually occurring.

**High Priority:**
Need to orchestrate the complete chat flow with detailed logging to understand exactly where the zero-chunk issue occurs in the full pipeline. The previous piecemeal approach didn't provide enough visibility into the complete process.

**New Approach:**
Instead of individual diagnostic steps, we need a comprehensive script that simulates the entire chat endpoint flow, including authentication, agent orchestration, and function calls with enhanced logging. This will provide complete visibility into where the issue occurs.

---

## Final Notes

This is a **CRITICAL blocker** for all RAG functionality. Users cannot get personalized insurance information without working chunk retrieval.

The investigation has been thorough on the threading/timeout side, but we need a more comprehensive approach to understand the complete chat flow. The new investigation strategy focuses on:

1. **Complete Chat Flow Simulation** - Orchestrate the entire process with detailed logging
2. **Interactive Debugging** - Break down the process into step-by-step analysis
3. **Structured Documentation** - Capture findings in a proper FRACAS investigation
4. **Validated Fixes** - Implement and verify corrective actions

**Key Success Factors:**
- Use the provided authentication credentials to test with real user data
- Focus on the complete pipeline, not just individual components
- Document everything for future reference and team knowledge
- Validate fixes thoroughly before considering the issue resolved

Good luck! üöÄ
