# FM-038 RCA: Production Logs Analysis

## üìä **Production Log Evidence (2025-10-09 04:41-04:43)**

```
2025-10-09 04:41:50,906 - RAG Operation Started [f70d9658-3a4f-4ef4-8f85-49b76cd6fbd7]
[2 MINUTES OF COMPLETE SILENCE - NO LOGS]
2025-10-09 04:43:48,905 - main - ERROR - Chat processing timed out after 120 seconds
INFO: 10.220.71.237:42586 - "POST /chat HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

## üîç **Critical Findings**

### **MISSING DIAGNOSTIC LOGS** ‚ö†Ô∏è

The threading fix was deployed, but we're **not seeing the expected diagnostic logging**:

**Expected Logs (from our fix):**
- ‚úÖ `"=== EMBEDDING GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS ==="`
- ‚úÖ `"Thread started for OpenAI API call"`
- ‚úÖ `"Thread completed OpenAI API call successfully"` OR
- ‚úÖ `"Thread failed with exception: {exception}"` OR
- ‚úÖ `"OpenAI embedding API call timed out after 25 seconds"`
- ‚úÖ `"Thread is still alive after timeout - investigating..."`

**Actual Logs (what we saw):**
- ‚ùå RAG Operation Started
- ‚ùå [SILENCE FOR 2 MINUTES]
- ‚ùå Chat processing timed out

### **Why Are We Not Seeing Failure Logs?**

#### **Hypothesis 1: Deployment Status** ü§î
**Likelihood**: HIGH

The threading fix (PR #14) was merged to main but might not have deployed to production yet.

**Evidence**:
- PR was merged at a specific time
- Production logs show old behavior (no diagnostic logging)
- No thread lifecycle logs visible

**Action Needed**:
- Verify production deployment status
- Check if new code is actually running
- Force redeploy if necessary

#### **Hypothesis 2: Logging Level Configuration** ü§î
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM

The diagnostic logs might be at INFO level but production is running at WARNING/ERROR level.

**Evidence**:
- We see ERROR logs ("Chat processing timed out")
- We see INFO logs for RAG Operation Started
- Missing INFO logs for thread lifecycle

**Counter-Evidence**:
- We DO see some INFO logs, so logging level should be OK

**Action Needed**:
- Verify logging configuration in production
- Check if RAGTool logger is configured differently

#### **Hypothesis 3: Exception Eating the Logs** ü§î
**Likelihood**: LOW

An exception might be occurring before our diagnostic logs run.

**Evidence**:
- Complete silence after RAG Operation Started
- No exception logs visible

**Action Needed**:
- Add try/except with logging at the very start of `_generate_embedding`
- Ensure all logging is before any potential exception points

#### **Hypothesis 4: Thread Hanging Before Logging** ü§î
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM

The thread might be hanging at a point before our logging statements execute.

**Evidence**:
- No "Thread started" logs
- Operation starts but then silence

**Possible Hang Points**:
```python
# Point 1: Before thread creation
result_queue = queue.Queue()  # Could this hang?
exception_queue = queue.Queue()

# Point 2: Inside api_call() before logging
def api_call():
    try:
        self.logger.info("Thread started...")  # <- Never reaches here?
```

**Action Needed**:
- Add logging BEFORE thread creation
- Add logging at the absolute start of api_call()
- Verify thread actually starts

## üéØ **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Primary Issue: Silent Hanging in RAG Embedding Generation**

**Timeline**:
1. `04:41:50` - RAG Operation Started (logged successfully)
2. `04:41:50 - 04:43:48` - **COMPLETE SILENCE** (118 seconds)
3. `04:43:48` - Chat processing timeout (120 seconds total)

**The Problem**:
The embedding generation is failing **silently** without triggering our diagnostic logging. This suggests:

1. **Code execution never reaches our diagnostic logs**, OR
2. **Logs are being suppressed/filtered**, OR  
3. **Thread is hanging before entering our logging code**

### **Why No Timeout at 25 Seconds?**

Our threading fix implements a **25-second timeout** for the embedding API call:

```python
thread.join(timeout=25.0)

if thread.is_alive():
    self.logger.error("OpenAI embedding API call timed out after 25 seconds")
    raise RuntimeError("OpenAI embedding API call timed out after 25 seconds")
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- After 25 seconds, we should see timeout error logs
- The exception should propagate up
- Chat should fail with error, not hang for 120 seconds

**Actual Behavior**:
- No timeout error logs at 25 seconds
- Operation hangs for full 120 seconds
- No diagnostic logging at all

**This Indicates**:
1. **The threading fix code is not running** (most likely), OR
2. **The thread.join(timeout=25.0) is not working as expected** (less likely), OR
3. **An exception is occurring before we reach the timeout check** (possible)

## üìã **Immediate Action Items**

### **1. Verify Deployment Status** üî¥ **CRITICAL**

```bash
# Check production deployment
gh pr view 14
gh pr checks 14

# Verify production code
# Check if the threading fix is actually deployed
```

**Expected**: PR #14 merged and deployed to production  
**If Not**: Force redeploy to production

### **2. Add Pre-Thread Logging** üî¥ **CRITICAL**

Add logging BEFORE any threading code to identify exactly where we hang:

```python
async def _generate_embedding(self, text: str) -> List[float]:
    self.logger.info("=== EMBEDDING GENERATION START ===")
    self.logger.info(f"Text length: {len(text)}")
    
    try:
        import os
        import time
        
        self.logger.info("Imports successful, getting API key")
        api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
        
        self.logger.info(f"API key retrieved: {bool(api_key)}")
        self.logger.info("About to create queues for threading")
        
        import threading
        import queue
        from openai import OpenAI
        
        self.logger.info("Threading imports successful")
        result_queue = queue.Queue()
        exception_queue = queue.Queue()
        self.logger.info("Queues created successfully")
        
        # ... rest of code
```

### **3. Add Exception Logging at Every Level** üü° **HIGH**

Wrap EVERYTHING in try/except with logging:

```python
try:
    self.logger.info("Starting thread creation")
    thread = threading.Thread(target=api_call)
    self.logger.info("Thread object created")
    thread.daemon = True
    self.logger.info("Thread set to daemon")
    thread.start()
    self.logger.info("Thread started successfully")
except Exception as e:
    self.logger.error(f"CRITICAL: Thread creation/start failed: {e}")
    raise
```

### **4. Add Heartbeat Logging** üü° **MEDIUM**

Add periodic logging to detect where we hang:

```python
def api_call():
    self.logger.info("HEARTBEAT 1: api_call() entered")
    try:
        self.logger.info("HEARTBEAT 2: Creating OpenAI client")
        sync_client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key, timeout=30.0)
        
        self.logger.info("HEARTBEAT 3: Client created, calling embeddings.create")
        response = sync_client.embeddings.create(...)
        
        self.logger.info("HEARTBEAT 4: API call completed")
        result_queue.put(response)
        self.logger.info("HEARTBEAT 5: Result queued")
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"HEARTBEAT ERROR: {e}")
        exception_queue.put(e)
```

## üî¨ **Investigation Questions**

1. **Is the threading fix code actually running in production?**
   - Check deployment status
   - Verify code version deployed

2. **Where exactly is the code hanging?**
   - Add heartbeat logging
   - Identify the last successful log before silence

3. **Why isn't the 25-second timeout firing?**
   - Verify thread.join(timeout=25.0) is being called
   - Check if thread is actually starting

4. **Is there an exception being swallowed?**
   - Add comprehensive exception logging
   - Check all exception handlers

## üéØ **Expected Next Steps**

1. **Deploy enhanced logging immediately** to identify hang point
2. **Monitor next production failure** with new logging
3. **Identify exact hang location** from heartbeat logs
4. **Implement targeted fix** based on findings

## üìä **Success Criteria**

After deploying enhanced logging, we should see:

‚úÖ **Heartbeat logs showing progression** through the code  
‚úÖ **Clear identification of hang point**  
‚úÖ **Exception logs if errors occur**  
‚úÖ **Timeout logs at 25 seconds** if operation hangs

## üö® **Current Status**

**Status**: üî¥ **CRITICAL - INVESTIGATING**  
**Issue**: Threading fix deployed but diagnostic logs not appearing  
**Priority**: üî¥ **HIGHEST** - Blocking production functionality  
**Next Action**: Deploy enhanced heartbeat logging to identify hang point
