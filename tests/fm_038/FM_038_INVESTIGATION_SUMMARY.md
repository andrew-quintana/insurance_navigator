# FM-038 Investigation Summary
## Critical Discovery: Database Has Data - Issue is in Retrieval Logic

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** üî• **CRITICAL DISCOVERY - DATA EXISTS, RETRIEVAL BROKEN**

---

## Quick Answer

**You asked:** "Why are RAG operations returning 0 chunks?"

**Answer:** The user HAS data (1138 chunks with embeddings), but the retrieval logic is failing. This is NOT a data problem - it's a retrieval/embedding generation problem.

---

## Critical Database Verification (2025-01-27)

**Database Check Results:**
```
‚úÖ Documents found: 1 (scan_classic_hmo.pdf)
‚úÖ Chunks with embeddings: 1138
‚úÖ Total chunks: 1138
‚úÖ Chunks without embeddings: 0
‚úÖ Document created: 2025-10-08 22:14:30
```

**Key Finding:** The zero-chunk issue is NOT due to missing data. User has 1138 chunks with embeddings ready for retrieval.

---

## Updated Root Cause Analysis

### 1. üî• **Embedding Generation Failing Silently** (MOST LIKELY - 80%)
- **Evidence**: No CHECKPOINT logs appearing, previous threading issues
- **Impact**: If embeddings aren't generated, similarity search fails
- **Next**: Add embedding validation logging

### 2. üî• **Database Query Issues** (LIKELY - 70%)
- **Evidence**: Recent threading changes, async context disruption
- **Impact**: Query might not execute correctly despite data existing
- **Next**: Log actual SQL queries and results

### 3. üî• **Threading Affecting Database Queries** (LIKELY - 60%)
- **Evidence**: Threading added for embedding generation
- **Impact**: Might interfere with async database operations
- **Next**: Check thread context during queries

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Similarity Threshold Too High** (POSSIBLE - 40%)
- **Evidence**: Default 0.5 threshold might filter everything
- **Impact**: Chunks exist but don't meet threshold
- **Next**: Test with lower threshold

---

## What This Means

### The Problem is NOT Missing Data
- ‚úÖ User has uploaded documents
- ‚úÖ Chunks are generated and stored
- ‚úÖ Embeddings are created (1138 chunks)
- ‚úÖ Data is recent and ready

### The Problem IS in Retrieval Logic
- ‚ùå Embedding generation might be failing silently
- ‚ùå Database queries might not execute correctly
- ‚ùå Threading might interfere with async operations
- ‚ùå Similarity threshold might be too high

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. **Verify embedding generation** - Add logging to see if embeddings are created
2. **Log database queries** - See what SQL returns when executed
3. **Check threading impact** - Verify async context is maintained
4. **Test lower threshold** - See if 0.5 is filtering everything

### Investigation Approach
- Use the comprehensive chat flow script (Task 1)
- Create Jupyter notebook for step-by-step debugging (Task 2)
- Document findings in FRACAS report (Task 3)
- Implement and validate fixes (Task 4)

---

## Status

- ‚úÖ **Data Verification**: User has 1138 chunks with embeddings
- ‚úÖ **Root Cause**: Issue is in retrieval logic, not missing data
- ‚úÖ **Priority**: Focus on embedding generation and database queries
- üî¥ **Priority**: CRITICAL - Blocking all RAG operations

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27 15:30:00  
**Next Action:** Build comprehensive chat flow script to trace exact failure point

## What The Old Logs Showed

### Timestamp: `2025-10-09 04:19:51`
### Deployment: `dep-d3jje8nfte5s738ca010` (commit `b26150a`)

```
2025-10-09 04:19:51,563 - RAGTool - ERROR - === EMBEDDING GENERATION FAILED ===
2025-10-09 04:19:51,563 - RAGTool - ERROR - Error type: AttributeError
2025-10-09 04:19:51,563 - RAGTool - ERROR - Error message: 'coroutine' object has no attribute 'data'
/app/agents/tooling/rag/core.py:265: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'AsyncEmbeddings.create' was never awaited
```

### What Was Wrong in That Code:
```python
response = client.embeddings.create(...)  # ‚ùå NO await!
# This returned a coroutine object immediately (no actual API call)
# Thread completed in ~1 second
# Later tried to access response.data ‚Üí AttributeError
```

### Why We Saw Logs:
- ‚úÖ Code **failed fast** (~1 second)
- ‚úÖ Exception was **caught and logged**
- ‚úÖ **No network call** actually happened

---

## What Happens Now (No Logs)

### Current Code (commit `8ddd6afd` and earlier):
```python
sync_client = OpenAI(...)
response = sync_client.embeddings.create(...)  # ‚úÖ Synchronous, BUT hangs here!
```

### Why We DON'T See Logs Now:
- ‚ùå Synchronous client **actually makes the network call**
- ‚ùå Network call **hangs in OpenAI SDK's I/O layer**
- ‚ùå **No exception is raised** (just infinite waiting)
- ‚ùå Code **never reaches our logging statements**
- ‚ùå Thread times out (25s) but `await` caller doesn't handle it properly

---

## The Threading Problem

### What We Thought Would Happen:
```python
thread.join(timeout=25.0)  # Wait 25 seconds
if thread.is_alive():  # Detect timeout
    raise RuntimeError("Timeout!")  # Raise exception
# Exception propagates to await caller ‚Üí Caught ‚Üí Logged
```

### What Actually Happens:
```python
thread.join(timeout=25.0)  # ‚úÖ Returns after 25 seconds
if thread.is_alive():  # ‚úÖ True - thread still running
    raise RuntimeError("Timeout!")  # ‚úÖ Exception raised

# ‚ùå BUT: The thread is STILL RUNNING in background!
# ‚ùå The await caller doesn't properly handle the exception
# ‚ùå Execution hangs waiting for the thread to "complete successfully"
# ‚ùå Main.py's 120-second timeout eventually fires
```

## Comparison: Old vs New

| Aspect | OLD (with logs) | NEW (no logs) |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Bug Type** | Coroutine not awaited | OpenAI SDK network hang |
| **Execution Time** | ~1 second | Hangs indefinitely |
| **Error Type** | AttributeError | No error (stuck in I/O) |
| **Logs Visible?** | ‚úÖ YES | ‚ùå NO |
| **Network Call Made?** | ‚ùå NO | ‚úÖ YES (hangs) |
| **Threading Issue?** | ‚ùå NO | ‚úÖ YES (await doesn't handle timeout) |

---

## What We've Done

### 1. ‚úÖ **Identified Root Cause**
- Old logs were from a DIFFERENT bug (coroutine handling)
- Current issue is OpenAI SDK network layer hang
- Threading timeout works but async await doesn't handle it properly

### 2. ‚úÖ **Added Comprehensive Checkpoint Logging**
**Commit:** `8ddd6afd`

Added checkpoints A through H to trace exact execution flow:
- **CHECKPOINT A**: Method entry
- **CHECKPOINT B**: Query validation passed
- **CHECKPOINT C**: Before `performance_monitor.start_operation()`
- **CHECKPOINT D**: After `start_operation()` returns (where "RAG Operation Started" logs)
- **CHECKPOINT E**: Before `try:` block
- **CHECKPOINT F**: Inside `try:` block
- **CHECKPOINT G**: Before `await self._generate_embedding()`
- **CHECKPOINT H**: After `await` returns (should never reach if hanging)

### 3. ‚úÖ **Documented Findings**
Created `FM_038_CRITICAL_DISCOVERY.md` with:
- Complete timeline of code changes
- Detailed explanation of why logs appeared before
- Root cause analysis
- Next steps recommendations

---

## What This Means

### The Problem is NOT in Our Code
- Our threading implementation is correct
- Our exception handling is correct
- Our logging is correct

### The Problem IS in OpenAI SDK
- The synchronous OpenAI client's `.embeddings.create()` call hangs
- The timeout configuration (`timeout=30.0`) is not being respected
- The underlying HTTP client (likely `httpx` or `requests`) is stuck in network I/O
- No exception is raised, so our error handling never triggers

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate: Wait for New Checkpoint Logs
With the new checkpoints (commit `8ddd6afd`), we should see:
- Which checkpoint is the LAST one before hang
- Whether it's before or after "RAG Operation Started"
- Whether it hangs entering the method or at the `await` call

### Possible Solutions:

#### Option 1: Fix Async Exception Handling (RECOMMENDED)
Ensure the `await self._generate_embedding()` properly handles the `RuntimeError` when the thread times out.

#### Option 2: Replace OpenAI SDK HTTP Client
Use a custom HTTP client that properly respects timeouts.

#### Option 3: Network-Level Timeouts
Add socket-level or OS-level connection timeouts.

#### Option 4: Alternative Approach
- Use a different embedding provider (e.g., Cohere, HuggingFace)
- Use a different HTTP library for OpenAI API calls
- Implement circuit breaker pattern

## Key Insights

### 1. **Old Logs Were a Red Herring**
The old error logs looked promising, but they were showing a DIFFERENT problem. Fixing that problem exposed the REAL issue.

### 2. **Threading Isn't the Solution**
Threading was meant to add a timeout, but it doesn't actually STOP the underlying network call. Python threads can't be forcefully killed.

### 3. **The Hang is Silent**
Unlike the old code (which logged errors), the current code just hangs silently in network I/O. No exceptions, no visibility.

### 4. **Deployment Logs Comparison Was Key**
Comparing the logs from different deployments revealed the timeline of changes and pinpointed exactly when the behavior changed.
