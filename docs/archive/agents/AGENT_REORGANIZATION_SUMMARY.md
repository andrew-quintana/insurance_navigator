# Agent Directory Reorganization Summary

## Overview
The agent directory structure has been flattened to make it more accessible. The nested `core/` directory has been eliminated, bringing commonly used files to the root level of each agent directory.

## Before (Old Structure)
```
agents/
  {agent_name}/
    core/
      {agent_name}.py          # Main agent file
      models/                  # Model definitions
      prompts/
        prompt_{agent}_v0_1.md # Current prompt
        examples/              # Current examples
        templates/             # Template files
        versions/              # Old versions
      examples/                # Current examples (alternative location)
    docs/                      # Documentation
    metrics/                   # Performance metrics
    tests/                     # Test files
    README.md
    changelog.md
    __init__.py
```

## After (New Structure)
```
agents/
  {agent_name}/
    {agent_name}.py            # Main agent file (moved up)
    models/                    # Model definitions (moved up)
    current_prompt.md          # Current prompt (copied for easy access)
    current_example.json       # Current example (copied for easy access)
    prompts/                   # All prompts including versions (moved up)
      prompt_{agent}_v0_1.md   # Original current prompt
      templates/               # Template files
      versions/                # Old versions
    examples/                  # All examples including versions (moved up)
      {example_files}          # Original example files
    docs/                      # Documentation (unchanged)
    metrics/                   # Performance metrics (unchanged)
    tests/                     # Test files (unchanged)
    README.md                  # Unchanged
    changelog.md               # Unchanged
    __init__.py                # Unchanged
```

## Key Changes

### 1. Eliminated Core Directory
- Removed the nested `core/` directory structure
- Moved all core files to the agent's root level

### 2. Easy Access to Current Files
- `current_prompt.md` - Current version of the agent's prompt at root level
- `current_example.json` - Current version of examples at root level
- `{agent_name}.py` - Main agent Python file at root level
- `models/` - Model definitions at root level

### 3. Preserved Versioning
- `prompts/` directory contains all prompt versions and templates
- `examples/` directory contains all example versions
- Old versions are still accessible but one level deeper

### 4. Updated Configuration
- `config/config.yaml` has been updated with new file paths
- All agent references now point to the flattened structure

## Benefits

1. **Faster Access**: No need to navigate through 3 levels to reach commonly used files
2. **Better Developer Experience**: Current files are immediately visible in the agent directory
3. **Preserved History**: Old versions and templates are still organized and accessible
4. **Cleaner Structure**: Less nesting makes the codebase easier to navigate

## Affected Agents

All agents have been reorganized:
- `prompt_security`
- `patient_navigator`
- `task_requirements`
- `service_access_strategy`
- `chat_communicator`
- `regulatory`

## Configuration Updates

The `config/config.yaml` file has been automatically updated to reflect the new paths:
- `core_file.path`: Updated to point to root-level Python files
- `prompt.path`: Updated to point to `current_prompt.md`
- `examples.path`: Updated to point to `current_example.json`

## Backward Compatibility

While the structure has changed, all functionality remains intact:
- All files are preserved in their new locations
- Configuration automatically updated
- No code changes required for agent functionality
