# Supabase Directory Consolidation

## Summary
On 2025-06-26, we consolidated the Supabase configuration and functions by archiving the root-level `/supabase` directory and standardizing on `/db/supabase` as the single source of truth for all Supabase-related code.

## Background
The project previously had two Supabase directories:
1. `/supabase` (root level)
2. `/db/supabase` (under db directory)

This caused confusion and potential synchronization issues between the two directories.

## Actions Taken
1. Created a backup of the root supabase directory in `backups/supabase_root_20250626_074412`
2. Moved the root supabase directory to `archive/supabase_root_deprecated`
3. Standardized on using `/db/supabase` as the single source of truth

## Migration Status
- All recent function changes have been properly reflected in `/db/supabase/functions`
- The directory structure and function implementations are consistent
- No functionality was lost in the consolidation

## Next Steps
1. Update all deployment scripts to use the `/db/supabase` path
2. Review and update any documentation referring to the old root-level supabase directory
3. Monitor for any issues related to the consolidation

## Note
If you need to reference the old implementation, it is available in:
- Backup: `backups/supabase_root_20250626_074412`
- Archive: `archive/supabase_root_deprecated`
