## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=documents
SIGNED_URL_EXPIRY_SECONDS=3600
```

### Database Schema
The integration automatically creates the `policy_documents` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE policy_documents (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    policy_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_path TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    original_filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    content_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_size INTEGER NOT NULL,
    document_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    uploaded_by TEXT NOT NULL,
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);

CREATE INDEX idx_policy_documents_policy_id ON policy_documents(policy_id);
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic File Upload
```python
from db.services.storage_service import get_storage_service

storage_service = await get_storage_service()

# Upload a policy document
result = await storage_service.upload_policy_document(
    policy_id="123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    file_data=file_bytes,
    filename="policy.pdf",
    user_id="user123",
    document_type="policy",
    metadata={"department": "claims"}
)

print(f"Uploaded: {result['file_path']}")
```

### Generate Signed URL
```python
# Get a download URL that expires in 1 hour
signed_url = await storage_service.get_signed_url(
    file_path=result['file_path'],
    expires_in=3600,
    download=True
)

print(f"Download URL: {signed_url}")
```

### List Policy Documents
```python
# List all active documents for a policy
documents = await storage_service.list_policy_documents(
    policy_id="123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
)

for doc in documents:
    print(f"{doc['original_filename']} - {doc['file_size']} bytes")
```

### Check Permissions
```python
# Check what a user can do with a file
permissions = await storage_service.get_file_access_permissions(
    file_path="policy/123/abc.pdf",
    user_id="user123"
)

if permissions['read']:
    print("User can read this file")
```

- Role-based permissions (owner, admin, user)
- Database-level access control for metadata

### File Security
- Secure file naming with UUIDs prevents path traversal
- Content type validation prevents malicious uploads
- File size limits prevent storage abuse
- Audit trail tracks all file operations
