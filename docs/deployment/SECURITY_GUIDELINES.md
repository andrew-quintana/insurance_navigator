## Security Principles

### Core Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary access and permissions
3. **Zero Trust**: Verify and validate all access attempts
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing security surveillance
5. **Incident Response**: Prepared response to security events

### Security by Design

- Security considerations integrated from the beginning
- Regular security reviews and updates
- Proactive threat identification and mitigation
- User education and awareness

## Secret Management

### Secret Classification

#### Critical Secrets (Highest Priority)
- JWT signing keys
- Database encryption keys
- API master keys
- Authentication tokens

#### High Priority Secrets
- Database connection strings
- External API keys
- Service account credentials
- OAuth client secrets

#### Medium Priority Secrets
- Configuration passwords
- Service passwords
- Internal API keys

#### Low Priority Secrets
- Public configuration values
- Non-sensitive identifiers
- Debug settings

### Secret Storage Requirements

#### Development Environment
- Store in `.env.development` file
- Use development-specific secrets
- Never use production secrets
- Document secret purposes

#### Production Environment
- Store in secure environment variable systems
- Use strong, randomly generated secrets
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Monitor secret access

### Secret Generation

#### Strong Secret Requirements
- **Length**: Minimum 32 characters
- **Character Set**: Mixed case, numbers, symbols
- **Entropy**: Cryptographically secure random generation
- **Uniqueness**: Unique per environment and service

#### Secret Generation Tools
```bash
# Generate JWT secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# Generate encryption key
openssl rand -hex 32

# Generate API key
openssl rand -base64 48
```

### Secret Rotation

#### Rotation Schedule
- **Critical Secrets**: Quarterly
- **High Priority Secrets**: Bi-annually
- **Medium Priority Secrets**: Annually
- **Emergency Rotation**: As needed for security incidents

#### Rotation Process
1. Generate new secret
2. Update in secure storage
3. Deploy to staging environment
4. Test functionality
5. Deploy to production
6. Remove old secret
7. Update documentation

## Access Controls

### Environment Access Levels

#### Development Environment
- **Full Access**: Development team members
- **Read Access**: QA team members
- **No Access**: External users

#### Production Environment
- **Full Access**: Senior developers and DevOps
- **Read Access**: Operations team
- **No Access**: Development team (except emergencies)

### Authentication Requirements

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Required for all production environment access
- Required for secret management systems
- Required for administrative functions

#### Strong Password Requirements
- Minimum 12 characters
- Mixed case, numbers, symbols
- No common patterns or dictionary words
- Unique per system

### Authorization Controls

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Admin**: Full system access
- **Developer**: Development environment access
- **Operator**: Production monitoring access
- **Auditor**: Read-only access for compliance

#### Principle of Least Privilege
- Grant minimum necessary permissions
- Regular access reviews
- Immediate revocation of unused access
- Document all access grants

- Encrypted backups
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Security Monitoring

#### Real-Time Monitoring
