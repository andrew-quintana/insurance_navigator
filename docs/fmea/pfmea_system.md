| Intake of user documents     | Files not uploaded or improperly formatted                  | System cannot proceed with guide creation      |   5 | User error; unsupported file type          |   4 | Intake Validation Agent checks for required docs     |   3 |   300 | Add drag-and-drop UX with real-time format validation          |
| Intake Validation            | Validation agent misclassifies a valid document as missing  | User is blocked or asked for redundant uploads |   4 | OCR or entity matching error               |   5 | Manual override option                               |   5 |   400 | Use dual OCR engines and a fallback matching heuristic         |
| Task Requirement Structuring | Incorrect or incomplete document checklist generated        | Critical data missing downstream               |   6 | Incomplete policy parsing logic            |   5 | Cross-check with RAG and plan coverage list          |   3 |   540 | Add document-type classification model with rule reinforcement |
| Intent Structuring           | Misinterpretation of user goal                              | Entire guide based on incorrect service need   |   7 | Ambiguous prompt or missed context         |   5 | Prompt chaining and clarification back to user       |   4 |   980 | Add a clarification round if confidence < threshold            |
| Service Strategy Generation  | Strategy does not lead to valid provider or violates policy | Rejected by compliance; frustrates user        |   5 | Overly constrained or misaligned logic     |   6 | Retry loop with threshold                            |   3 |   450 | Weight past failure modes to penalize risky strategies         |
| Policy Compliance Evaluation | Incorrect rejection or approval of a strategy               | Invalid guide or user denied rightful service  |   8 | RAG output misaligned; outdated CMS logic  |   4 | Self-consistency chain + regulation version tracking |   4 |  1024 | Add version-based exception path and human audit trigger       |
| Provider Identification      | Provider list returned is empty or irrelevant               | User cannot act on guide, loses trust          |   5 | Poor query logic or outdated location API  |   6 | CMS API fallback, local cache check                  |   3 |   450 | Introduce proximity + availability scoring and backup radius   |
| Guide Assembly               | Incorrect or mismatched data in guide output                | User receives broken or unusable document      |   6 | Mapping logic failure between components   |   5 | Guide QA agent + format validator                    |   4 |   720 | Introduce step-by-step trace logging for debugging             |
| PDF Generation               | PDF creation fails or has corrupted formatting              | User cannot access or share output             |   4 | PDF engine crash or invalid content tokens |   4 | Regeneration fallback, versioning                    |   2 |   128 | Add HTML fallback or inline user-accessible version            |
| Final QA and Delivery        | Failure undetected in final review                          | User sees bad output; harms reputation         |   7 | Quality Agent missed an edge case          |   4 | ReAct QA, redundancy in review                       |   3 |   588 | Add statistical anomaly detection on final guide structure     |
