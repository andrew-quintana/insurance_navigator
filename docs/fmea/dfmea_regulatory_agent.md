| Function              | Failure Mode                                    | Effect                                                    | Severity | Cause                                                      | Occurrence | Controls                                                      | Detection | RPN | Recommended Actions |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----|-------------------|
| Scan for PII/PHI     | Fails to detect sensitive user data            | Privacy violation; major trust/regulatory failure         | 10       | Obfuscated format bypasses detection model                 | 4          | Named entity recognition + regex filters                      | 3         | 1200| Add structured PHI type validation |
| Validate compliance  | Fails to apply current regulatory rules        | Sends unsafe data to user or logs                         | 9        | Outdated policy definitions or missed interaction          | 3          | Regulation check via compliance API                           | 3         | 81  | Implement regulatory update subscription |
| Redact sensitive content   | Removes needed non-sensitive info (false positive)    | Output lacks clarity or utility                 |   5 | Overlapping term (e.g., "Name" used generically)    |   6 | Rule-based whitelist for context                |   4 |   600 | Add NLP context classifier to prevent over-redaction            |
| Log compliance result      | Logs missing or non-standard                          | No audit trail for breach detection or review   |   6 | Logging bug or race condition                       |   4 | Centralized audit log with retry-on-fail        |   4 |   576 | Introduce checksum validation and redundant logging pipeline    |
| Block non-compliant output | Allows sensitive content through or blocks safe one   | User data exposed or blocked without cause      |   8 | Confidence threshold error; misclassified redaction |   5 | Final validation layer and manual audit trigger |   4 |  1280 | Add severity-based escalation logic and alert audit system      |
