## Technical Details

### Code Changes
```typescript
// Environment Configuration Interface
interface EnvironmentConfig {
  environment: Environment;
  api: ServiceConfig;
  database: DatabaseConfig;
  frontend: FrontendConfig;
  external: ExternalApiConfig;
  security: SecurityConfig;
  monitoring: MonitoringConfig;
}

// Environment Detection and Loading
export function getEnvironmentConfig(): EnvironmentConfig {
  const config = loadEnvironmentConfig();
  const validation = validateEnvironmentConfig(config);
  
  if (!validation.isValid && config.environment === 'production') {
    throw new Error('Production environment configuration is invalid');
  }
  
  return config;
}
```

### Configuration Changes
```yaml
# Package.json Scripts
scripts:
  validate:environment: "ts-node scripts/validate-environment.ts"
  sync:environments: "ts-node scripts/sync-environments.ts"
  security:audit: "ts-node scripts/security-audit.ts"
  test:environment: "jest config/environments/__tests__/"
  test:scripts: "jest scripts/__tests__/"
```

### Infrastructure Changes
- **New Resources:** Environment configuration system, validation utilities, security auditing tools
- **Modified Resources:** Package.json updated with new scripts and dependencies
- **Deprecated Resources:** None - this is a new implementation

## Issues Encountered

### Resolved Issues
1. **Issue:** TypeScript compilation errors in environment configuration
   - **Cause:** Missing type definitions and import issues
   - **Solution:** Added proper type definitions and fixed import paths
   - **Prevention:** Use proper TypeScript configuration and linting

2. **Issue:** Jest test configuration complexity
   - **Cause:** Complex mocking requirements for environment variables
   - **Solution:** Created comprehensive Jest setup with proper mocking
   - **Prevention:** Use consistent test patterns and setup files

### Open Issues
None - all implementation completed successfully

### Blockers
None - no blocking issues encountered

## Testing & Validation

### Unit Testing
- **Tests Added:** 15+ test cases covering environment detection, configuration loading, validation, and error handling
