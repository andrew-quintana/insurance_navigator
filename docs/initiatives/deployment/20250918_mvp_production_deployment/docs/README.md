- Security audit results
- Testing documentation for environment switching
- Configuration migration guides

### Phase 2 - CI/CD Pipeline Implementation  
- CI/CD pipeline configuration files
- Deployment testing results
- Platform integration validation reports
- Rollback procedure documentation

### Phase 3 - Production Operations Setup
- Monitoring dashboard configurations
- Health check implementation documentation
- Performance optimization results
- Operations runbook drafts

### Phase 4 - Production Deployment & Validation
- Production deployment validation reports
- Team training materials
- Final operations documentation
- Lessons learned and recommendations

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names with dates: `YYYY-MM-DD_document_name.md`
- Phase prefix for organization: `phase1_environment_validation_2025-09-25.md`
- Version control for iterative documents: `_v1`, `_v2`, etc.

### Content Requirements
- **Date and Author:** All documents must include creation date and author
- **Status:** Current status (Draft, Review, Complete, Deprecated)
- **Dependencies:** Any dependencies on other documents or systems
- **Validation:** Testing or validation steps taken
- **Handoff Notes:** Information needed for next phase or team member

### Review Process
1. **Technical Review:** Implementation team validates technical accuracy
2. **Documentation Review:** Ensure clarity and completeness
3. **Handoff Validation:** Verify next phase can proceed with documentation
4. **Archive:** Move completed documents to appropriate phase directory

## Implementation Guidelines

### As You Implement
1. **Document Decisions:** Record technical decisions and rationale
2. **Track Issues:** Document problems encountered and solutions
3. **Validate Results:** Include test results and validation evidence
4. **Update Status:** Keep document status current throughout implementation

### Phase Handoffs
- Complete phase documentation before moving to next phase
- Include explicit handoff notes for next implementer
- Validate that documentation enables independent work
- Archive completed phase materials

## Templates Available

Templates for common implementation documents will be added as needed:
- Configuration validation templates
- Testing report templates  
- Deployment procedure templates
- Operations runbook templates

## Contact & Support

**Documentation Questions:** Reference scoping documents in `../scoping/`  
**Implementation Support:** Development team lead
