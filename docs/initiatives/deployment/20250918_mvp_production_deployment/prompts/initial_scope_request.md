# Initial Scope Request

**Date:** 2025-09-18  
**Requester:** User  
**AI Assistant:** Claude (Sonnet 4)  

## Original Prompt

```
scope a production deployment effort for the current state of the project to carry out any refactors to allow for flexibility between development and the production environments under @docs/initiatives/deployment/20250918_mvp_production_deployment . the production environment is the already established cloud instances in render and supabase. reference @.env.production via `cat .env.production` as needed. use @docs/meta/templates/ and documentation practices outlined for creating a specification/prd doc, rfc, and a phased todo with proper documentaiton specified between each phase for handoff and ongoing documentation
```

## Context Analysis

### Input Context
- **Project State:** Active development with established cloud infrastructure
- **Production Environment:** Render (API) + Supabase (Database) + Vercel (Frontend)
- **Requirements:** Environment flexibility, refactoring for dev/prod separation
- **Documentation Standards:** Follow established templates in `docs/meta/templates/`

### Discovery Process
1. **Environment Analysis:** Reviewed `.env.production` for current configuration
2. **Infrastructure Review:** Examined existing deployment documentation
3. **Template Analysis:** Reviewed `docs/meta/templates/` for documentation patterns
4. **Project Structure:** Analyzed package.json files and deployment configurations

### Key Findings
- Production infrastructure already established but manual processes
- Environment variable management needs consolidation
- Free tier limitations require optimization strategies
- Missing automated deployment and monitoring capabilities

## Approach Taken

### Documentation Strategy
- **PRD.md:** Product requirements with user stories and acceptance criteria
- **RFC.md:** Technical architecture with interface contracts
- **TODO.md:** 4-phase implementation plan with handoff documentation
- **CONTEXT.md:** Initiative overview and stakeholder information

### Scoping Methodology
1. **Current State Assessment:** Analyzed existing configurations and documentation
2. **Gap Analysis:** Identified missing automation and environment management
3. **Risk Assessment:** Evaluated free tier constraints and deployment challenges
4. **Phased Planning:** Structured 4-week implementation timeline

### Documentation Standards Applied
- Followed template structure from `docs/meta/templates/`
- Included interface contracts and implementation details
- Provided detailed handoff documentation between phases
- Created comprehensive context and success criteria

## Deliverables Generated

### Scoping Documents
- **PRD.md:** Product requirements document
- **RFC.md:** Request for comments technical specification
- **TODO.md:** Phased implementation plan
- **CONTEXT.md:** Initiative context and overview

### Supporting Documentation
- **README.md:** Initiative overview and quick start guide
- **prompts/:** Prompt documentation and analysis
- **docs/:** Space for implementation artifacts
- **scoping/:** Core planning documents

## Next Steps Identified

1. **Stakeholder Review:** Review and approve scoping documents
2. **Resource Allocation:** Assign development team for 4-week timeline
3. **Phase 1 Implementation:** Begin environment configuration management
4. **Progress Tracking:** Weekly reviews and blocker resolution
