## Implementation Tasks

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow Setup

#### Production Deployment Pipeline
Based on RFC.md CI/CD pipeline specifications and TODO.md Phase 2 requirements:

**Primary Workflow - Production Deploy**
Create `.github/workflows/production-deploy.yml`:

```yaml
# Implement CI/CD pipeline from RFC.md:
# - Automated deployment on main branch
# - Quality gates and validation
# - Platform integration (Render + Vercel)
# - Rollback capabilities
```

**Supporting Workflow - PR Validation**
Create `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`:

```yaml
# Implement PR validation pipeline:
# - TypeScript compilation validation
# - ESLint and security rule enforcement
# - Test suite execution
# - Performance benchmark validation
```

**Deliverables:**
- Complete GitHub Actions workflows with proper triggers
- Manual approval gates for production deployments
- Integration with Phase 1 environment configuration system
- Comprehensive logging and status reporting

#### Quality Gates Implementation
Following PRD.md Epic 2 acceptance criteria:

**Validation Requirements:**
- TypeScript compilation validation in CI
- ESLint and security rule enforcement
- Test suite execution requirements (all tests must pass)
- Performance benchmark validation (response time thresholds)
- Security scan integration
- Build artifact validation

### 2. Platform Integration

#### Render Deployment Optimization
Based on current Render setup documented in DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md:

**Tasks:**
- Configure production build settings in render.yaml
- Optimize Docker build process for faster deployments
- Set up environment variables management in Render dashboard
- Integrate with Phase 1 environment configuration

**Deliverables:**
- Optimized `render.yaml` configuration
- Automated Render deployment triggers from GitHub main branch
- Environment variable synchronization with Phase 1 system
- Build performance monitoring and optimization

#### Vercel Deployment Configuration
Based on current Vercel setup in ui/DEPLOYMENT.md:

**Tasks:**
- Optimize Next.js build configuration for production
- Configure Vercel environment variables synchronization
- Set up domain and SSL configuration
- Integrate with Phase 1 environment management

**Deliverables:**
- Updated `ui/vercel.json` with production optimizations
- Automated Vercel deployment from CI/CD pipeline
- Environment variable management integration
- Build and deployment monitoring

#### Integration Testing Pipeline
Comprehensive testing following RFC.md testing strategy:

**Deliverables:**
- End-to-end testing pipeline for deployment validation
- Staging environment deployment for testing
- Production smoke tests after deployment
- Database migration testing in CI/CD

### 3. Deployment Automation & Monitoring

#### Automated Deployment Configuration
Following TODO.md Phase 2 automation requirements:

**Features:**
- Deployment status monitoring and notifications
- Automated rollback capabilities for failed deployments
- Health check integration post-deployment
- Deployment metrics collection

#### Rollback Procedures
Critical requirement from PRD.md Epic 2:

**Deliverables:**
- Automated rollback triggers for failed health checks
- Manual rollback procedures and documentation
- Database rollback strategies (if applicable)
- Rollback testing and validation procedures

### 4. Monitoring & Alerting Integration

#### CI/CD Pipeline Monitoring
Following RFC.md monitoring specifications:

**Features:**
- Build time monitoring and alerting
- Deployment success/failure notifications
- Performance regression detection
- Security scan result integration

**Deliverables:**
- Slack/email notifications for deployment status
- Dashboard for CI/CD pipeline metrics
- Alert thresholds for build time and success rates
- Integration with existing monitoring systems

## Success Criteria

Based on PRD.md Epic 2 acceptance criteria:

- [ ] **Automated Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline deploys automatically on merge to main
- [ ] **Health Checks**: Deployment includes proper health checks and rollback capabilities
- [ ] **Quality Validation**: Build and test validation occurs before production deployment
- [ ] **Status Communication**: Deployment status is clearly communicated to stakeholders
- [ ] **Platform Integration**: Both Render and Vercel deployments automated and tested
- [ ] **Performance**: Deployment process completes within acceptable time limits (<10 minutes)

## Quality Gates

Before considering Phase 2 complete:

1. **Pipeline Functionality**: All GitHub Actions workflows execute successfully
2. **Quality Validation**: All quality gates pass (tests, lint, security, performance)
3. **Platform Integration**: Both Render and Vercel deployments working automatically
4. **Rollback Capability**: Rollback procedures tested and verified
5. **Documentation**: Complete CI/CD procedures documented and validated
6. **Performance**: Deployment times meet target thresholds from RFC.md

## Implementation Standards

### GitHub Actions Best Practices
- Use secrets management for sensitive data
- Implement proper job dependencies and parallel execution
- Add comprehensive logging and error handling
- Use caching for dependencies and build artifacts
- Implement proper timeout and retry logic

### Platform Integration Standards
- Follow platform-specific best practices (Render, Vercel)
- Implement proper error handling for platform APIs
- Use environment-aware configuration from Phase 1
- Ensure consistency between platforms

## Implementation Notes

Document implementation progress using:
- **Implementation Notes**: `@docs/initiatives/deployment/20250918_mvp_production_deployment/docs/phase2/implementation_notes.md`
- **Validation Report**: `@docs/initiatives/deployment/20250918_mvp_production_deployment/docs/phase2/validation_report.md`

Follow the patterns established in Phase 1 and template documents to ensure consistency.

## Phase 2 Handoff Requirements

Upon completion, prepare handoff documentation using the handoff checklist template:

### Required Deliverables for Phase 3
1. **CI/CD Pipeline Testing Results**: Complete validation report with performance metrics
2. **Deployment Automation Validation**: Proof that automated deployments work end-to-end
3. **Platform Integration Testing Results**: Verification of Render and Vercel integration
4. **Rollback Procedure Testing**: Documentation that rollback procedures work correctly

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline working for both development and production deployments
- [ ] Quality gates functioning and preventing bad deployments
- [ ] Platform integrations tested and stable
- [ ] Rollback procedures validated
- [ ] Documentation complete and actionable for Phase 3 team

## Integration with Phase 1

Ensure proper integration with Phase 1 deliverables:
- Use environment configuration system from Phase 1
- Integrate security validation from Phase 1
- Leverage environment switching capabilities
- Follow environment management procedures

## Support Resources
