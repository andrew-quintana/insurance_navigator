## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Comprehensive Health Monitoring

#### Health Check Endpoints
Based on RFC.md monitoring architecture and TODO.md Phase 3 requirements:

**Primary Health Endpoint**
Implement `/api/health` with detailed system status:

```typescript
interface HealthStatus {
  status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unhealthy';
  timestamp: string;
  services: {
    database: ServiceHealth;
    external_apis: ServiceHealth[];
    memory: ResourceHealth;
    disk: ResourceHealth;
  };
  version: string;
  environment: string;
}
```

**Deep Health Validation**
Implement `/api/health/deep` for thorough system validation:
- Database connectivity and query performance

- Set up alerting for service degradation
- Create status page for system transparency
- Integration with health check endpoints

### 2. Free Tier Optimization

#### Render Free Tier Optimization
Critical for maintaining service availability within free tier constraints:

**Keep-Warm Strategy Implementation**
Create `scripts/keep-warm.ts`:

```typescript
// Implement automated keep-warm strategy:
// - Periodic health check requests (every 10-12 minutes)
// - Smart scheduling to avoid sleep mode
// - Graceful handling of cold starts
// - Cost-aware optimization
```

**Optimization Tasks:**
- Cold start performance optimization
- Memory usage optimization
- Graceful degradation for sleep mode scenarios
- Documentation of free tier limitations and user impact

**Deliverables:**
- Working keep-warm automation system
- Cold start optimization implementation
- Free tier impact analysis and user communication
- Monitoring integration for sleep mode events

#### Supabase Free Tier Management
Database optimization within free tier limits:

**Management Features:**
- Monitor database usage and connection limits
- Implement connection pooling optimization
- Set up usage alerts before tier limits
- Plan for tier upgrade scenarios

**Deliverables:**
- Database usage monitoring system
- Connection optimization implementation
- Usage alerting configuration
- Tier upgrade planning documentation

### 3. Logging & Error Tracking

#### Centralized Logging Implementation
Following RFC.md logging architecture:

**Logging Standardization:**
- Application-level logging standardization
- Error aggregation and categorization
- Performance metrics logging
- Security event logging

**Log Structure:**
```typescript
interface LogEntry {
  timestamp: string;
  level: 'error' | 'warn' | 'info' | 'debug';
  service: string;
  message: string;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
  trace_id?: string;
  user_id?: string;
}
```

**Deliverables:**
- Standardized logging implementation across application
