# MVP Production Deployment Initiative - Phase Implementation Prompts

**Initiative**: MVP Production Deployment  
**Date Created**: 2025-09-18  
**Status**: Implementation Ready  
**Duration**: 4 weeks (4 phases)

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive implementation prompts for each phase of the MVP Production Deployment initiative. Each prompt provides detailed guidance for implementing that phase while ensuring proper handoffs and integration between phases.

## Phase Structure

The initiative is organized into 4 sequential phases, each with specific deliverables and handoff requirements:

### Phase 1: Environment Configuration Management (Week 1)
**Prompt**: `phase1_environment_configuration.md`

**Objective**: Implement comprehensive environment configuration management for proper development/production separation.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Environment configuration system (`config/environments/`)
- Environment validation utilities (`scripts/validate-environment.ts`)
- Security hardening for production secrets
- Environment management documentation

**Handoff to Phase 2**: Environment configuration test results, security audit, switching procedures

### Phase 2: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation (Week 2)
**Prompt**: `phase2_cicd_pipeline.md`

**Objective**: Implement automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for consistent, reliable production deployments.

**Key Deliverables:**
- GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/`)
- Quality gates and validation
- Platform integration (Render + Vercel)
- Rollback capabilities

**Handoff to Phase 3**: CI/CD pipeline testing results, deployment automation validation, platform integration testing

### Phase 3: Production Operations Setup (Week 3)
**Prompt**: `phase3_production_operations.md`

**Objective**: Implement production monitoring, free tier optimization, logging, and error tracking.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Health monitoring endpoints (`/api/health`, `/api/health/deep`)
- Free tier optimization (`scripts/keep-warm.ts`)
- Centralized logging and error tracking
- Operations runbook

**Handoff to Phase 4**: Operations runbook, monitoring dashboard, performance baseline, optimization results

### Phase 4: Production Deployment & Validation (Week 4)
**Prompt**: `phase4_production_deployment.md`

**Objective**: Execute final production deployment with comprehensive validation and team enablement.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Final production deployment
- Team training and knowledge transfer
- Operations handoff
- Complete documentation

**Final Deliverable**: Fully operational production system with trained team

## Prompt Usage Guidelines

### For Implementation Teams

#### Getting Started
1. **Read Core Documents First**: Start with scoping documents (PRD.md, RFC.md, TODO.md)
2. **Review Previous Phase Handoffs**: Understand what was delivered by previous phases
3. **Understand Current State**: Review existing infrastructure and configuration
4. **Follow Implementation Order**: Complete phases sequentially - each builds on previous phases

#### During Implementation
1. **Document Progress**: Use implementation notes template for detailed progress tracking
2. **Create Validation Reports**: Document testing and validation using validation report template
3. **Prepare Handoff Materials**: Use handoff checklist template for phase transitions
4. **Reference Architecture**: Use RFC.md for technical decision context

#### Quality Standards
- All implementations must follow patterns established in scoping documents
- Documentation must use provided templates for consistency
- Testing must validate against success criteria in PRD.md
- Security must follow guidelines established in Phase 1

### For AI Assistants

#### Implementation Support
- Reference specific sections of scoping documents for context
- Use template documents for consistent formatting
- Integrate with previous phase deliverables
- Follow systematic investigation process for issues

#### Documentation Standards
- Use file:line references for code changes
- Include evidence and validation results
- Maintain chronological implementation timeline
- Cross-reference related documents and decisions

## Integration Architecture

### Phase Dependencies
```
Phase 1 (Environment) → Phase 2 (CI/CD) → Phase 3 (Operations) → Phase 4 (Deployment)
```

Each phase builds on previous deliverables:
- **Phase 2** uses environment configuration from Phase 1
- **Phase 3** integrates with CI/CD pipeline from Phase 2
- **Phase 4** validates all previous phase implementations

### Document Integration
Each prompt references:
- **Core scoping documents** for context and requirements
- **Previous phase handoffs** for integration requirements
- **Current state analysis** for understanding existing systems
- **Template documents** for consistent documentation

## Success Metrics Integration

All phases work toward achieving initiative success metrics from README.md:

- **Deployment Time**: <10 minutes for standard deployments
- **Success Rate**: 95% automated deployment success rate
- **Uptime**: 99.5% availability accounting for free tier sleep
- **Team Capability**: All team members able to execute deployments
