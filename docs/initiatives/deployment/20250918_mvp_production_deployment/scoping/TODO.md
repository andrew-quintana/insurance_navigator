## Blockers

### Current Blockers
- **Free Tier Limitations**: Render sleep mode affects user experience - requires keep-warm implementation
- **Environment Variable Management**: Multiple platforms require manual synchronization - automation needed
- **Deployment Dependencies**: Current manual deployment creates risk - automated pipeline required

### Risk Mitigation
- **Rollback Procedures**: Must be tested and documented before automated deployment
- **Monitoring Coverage**: Critical paths must have monitoring before production cutover
- **Security Validation**: Production secrets and access controls must be audited

## Testing & Technical Debt Tracking

### Phase Handoff Testing Summaries
Each phase must provide testing summary for handoff to next phase:
- [ ] **Phase 1 → Phase 2 Handoff**: Environment configuration testing results and validation coverage
- [ ] **Phase 2 → Phase 3 Handoff**: CI/CD pipeline testing results and automation validation
- [ ] **Phase 3 → Phase 4 Handoff**: Operations monitoring testing and performance validation

### Initiative Completion Requirements
- [ ] **Final Testing Summary**: Comprehensive testing report across all phases for initiative completion
- [ ] **Technical Debt Documentation**: Complete technical debt catalog and remediation roadmap (initiative end only)

### Quality Assurance Standards
- Phase handoff testing summaries must document validation coverage and any limitations for next phase
- Final technical debt documentation must include impact assessment, prioritization, and remediation timelines
- All testing summaries must include both automated and manual validation results

## Notes

### Implementation Decisions
- **Environment Configuration**: Using TypeScript for type safety and validation
- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions for integration with existing repository
- **Monitoring Strategy**: External monitoring for uptime, internal monitoring for health
- **Free Tier Strategy**: Implement keep-warm with external monitoring service

### Dependencies
- **External Services**: Render, Vercel, Supabase availability and stability
- **API Dependencies**: OpenAI, Anthropic, LlamaCloud rate limits and availability
- **Team Resources**: Developer time for testing and validation during each phase

### Success Metrics
- **Deployment Time**: Target <10 minutes for standard deployments
- **Success Rate**: Target 95% deployment success rate
- **Monitoring Coverage**: 100% of critical paths monitored
- **Documentation**: All procedures documented and tested
- **Team Capability**: All team members able to execute deployments independently
