# PRD 001 — MVP Production Deployment

## Problem & Goals

The Insurance Navigator application currently exists in development with established cloud infrastructure (Render + Supabase) but lacks proper production deployment configuration and environment management flexibility. The goal is to enable seamless deployment to production while maintaining development environment isolation.

**Key Objectives:**
- Enable production deployment with minimal manual intervention
- Establish clear environment separation between development and production
- Ensure scalability and maintainability of deployment processes
- Maintain security best practices for production environments

## Adjacent Systems Considered (with citations + dates)

- **Render Cloud Platform** — last_updated: 2025-09-18 — [docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md] [.env.production] [ui/DEPLOYMENT.md]
  - Impact on design choices: Production-ready with free tier limitations (sleep after 15min), requires keep-warm strategies
- **Supabase Cloud Database** — last_updated: 2025-09-18 — [.env.production]
  - Impact on design choices: Already configured with production instance, connection pooling established
- **Vercel Frontend Hosting** — last_updated: 2025-09-18 — [ui/DEPLOYMENT.md] [ui/vercel.json]
  - Impact on design choices: Automatic deployments configured, requires environment variable synchronization
- **Next.js Frontend Framework** — last_updated: 2025-09-18 — [ui/package.json] [ui/next.config.js]
  - Impact on design choices: Build optimization and environment configuration patterns established

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Epic 1: Environment Configuration Management
**As a developer**, I want clear environment separation so that I can work safely without affecting production.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration files are properly organized
- [ ] Development and production environments have isolated resources
- [ ] Environment variables are securely managed and documented
- [ ] Configuration validation scripts exist for both environments

### Epic 2: Automated Production Deployment
**As a devops engineer**, I want automated deployment processes so that releases are consistent and reliable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline deploys automatically on merge to main
- [ ] Deployment includes proper health checks and rollback capabilities
- [ ] Build and test validation occurs before production deployment
- [ ] Deployment status is clearly communicated to stakeholders

### Epic 3: Production Monitoring & Maintenance
**As a system administrator**, I want monitoring and maintenance tools so that I can ensure system reliability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Health monitoring endpoints are implemented and tested
- [ ] Error logging and alerting systems are configured
- [ ] Performance metrics are tracked and reported
- [ ] Keep-warm strategies are implemented for free tier limitations

### Epic 4: Documentation & Handoff
**As a team member**, I want comprehensive documentation so that deployments can be managed by any qualified team member.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Step-by-step deployment guides are current and tested
- [ ] Troubleshooting documentation covers common scenarios
- [ ] Environment setup procedures are documented
- [ ] Rollback procedures are documented and tested

## Metrics / Guardrails

- **Deployment Success Rate**: 95% of deployments complete without manual intervention
- **Environment Isolation**: Zero cross-contamination between dev/prod environments
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% of deployment procedures documented and tested
- **Security Compliance**: All production secrets managed securely, no hardcoded credentials
- **Performance**: Production deployment completes within 10 minutes
- **Uptime**: Production services maintain 99.5% uptime accounting for free tier sleep limitations

## Risks / Open Questions

### High Priority Risks
- **Free Tier Sleep Mode**: Render free tier sleeps after 15 minutes, affecting user experience
- **Database Connection Limits**: Supabase free tier connection pooling may be insufficient for production load
- **Environment Variable Drift**: Manual environment variable management across platforms creates risk of configuration mismatch

### Medium Priority Risks
- **Build Time Optimization**: Large bundle sizes may exceed Vercel build time limits
- **CORS Configuration**: Complex CORS patterns may break with environment changes
- **API Rate Limiting**: External API dependencies (OpenAI, Anthropic) may hit rate limits in production

### Open Questions
- Should we implement blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime releases?
- What monitoring/alerting level is appropriate for MVP stage?
- How should we handle database migrations in production?
- What backup and disaster recovery procedures are needed?

### Dependencies
- Render deployment platform availability and performance
- Supabase database service reliability
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
- External API service availability (OpenAI, Anthropic, LlamaCloud)
