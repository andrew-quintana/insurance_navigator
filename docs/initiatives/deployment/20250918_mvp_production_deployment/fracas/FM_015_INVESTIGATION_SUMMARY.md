# FM-015 Investigation Summary

## 🎯 **Investigation Status**
**Status**: READY FOR INVESTIGATION  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Component**: Webhook Processing Pipeline  

## 📋 **What We Know**

### **Confirmed Working**
- ✅ Webhook is being received by API service
- ✅ LlamaParse API is successfully processing documents (200 OK responses)
- ✅ Database schema is correct and accessible (`upload_pipeline.upload_jobs` table exists)
- ✅ Storage operations are working
- ✅ Worker is generating correct production webhook URLs

### **Suspected Issues**
- ❌ Webhook processing stops after reception
- ❌ Missing processing steps in webhook workflow
- ❌ Database updates may not be completing
- ❌ Storage operations may be failing

## 🔧 **Investigation Tools Deployed**

### **Enhanced Logging**

- **Deployment**: Live in production
- **Logging Features**:
  - Step-by-step processing logs with 🔔 emoji prefixes
  - Database operation tracking
  - Storage operation tracking
  - Content processing tracking
  - Error handling tracking
  - Detailed payload analysis

### **Log Categories**
1. **🔔 WEBHOOK START**: Initial webhook reception
2. **🔔 DATABASE STEP**: Database operations
3. **🔔 SIGNATURE STEP**: Webhook signature verification
4. **🔔 PAYLOAD STEP**: Payload parsing and analysis
5. **🔔 PROCESSING STEP**: Webhook status processing
6. **🔔 CONTENT STEP**: Content extraction and validation
7. **🔔 STORAGE STEP**: Storage operations
8. **🔔 ERROR STEP**: Error handling
9. **🔔 COMPLETION**: Successful completion
10. **🔔 EXCEPTION**: Exception handling

## 🧪 **Next Steps for Investigation**

### **Phase 1: Trigger Test Webhook**
1. Upload a test document to trigger webhook processing
2. Monitor API service logs for detailed processing steps
3. Identify exact point of failure

### **Phase 2: Analyze Logs**
1. Review all 🔔 prefixed logs from webhook processing
2. Identify which step fails or stops
3. Analyze error messages and stack traces
4. Check database and storage operation results

### **Phase 3: Root Cause Analysis**
1. Determine specific failing component
2. Identify configuration issues
3. Find missing dependencies or permissions
4. Locate logic errors in processing workflow

### **Phase 4: Corrective Action**
1. Implement fixes based on findings
2. Test complete webhook processing workflow
3. Verify end-to-end pipeline functionality

## 📊 **Expected Log Output**

When webhook processing works correctly, you should see logs like:
```

🔔 CONTENT STEP 3: Parsed content preview: '# Document Title...'
🔔 CONTENT STEP 4: Parsed content received successfully - length: 1234
🔔 STORAGE STEP 1: Generating storage path
🔔 STORAGE STEP 2: Generated parsed_path: storage://files/user/{user_id}/parsed/{document_id}.md
🔔 STORAGE STEP 3: Starting blob storage upload for document {document_id}
🔔 STORAGE STEP 4: Importing httpx for HTTP client
🔔 STORAGE STEP 5: Extracting bucket and key from parsed_path
🔔 STORAGE STEP 6: Path parts: ['files', 'user/{user_id}/parsed/{document_id}.md']
🔔 STORAGE STEP 7: Extracted bucket: files, key: user/{user_id}/parsed/{document_id}.md
🔔 STORAGE STEP 8: Uploading parsed content to bucket: files, key: user/{user_id}/parsed/{document_id}.md
🔔 STORAGE STEP 9: Getting environment variables
🔔 STORAGE STEP 10: SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY found
🔔 STORAGE STEP 11: SUPABASE_URL found: https://znvwzkdblknkkztqyfnu.supabase.co
