# Investigation Prompt: FM-018 Generic Response Generation

## Mission
Investigate and resolve FM-018: System generating generic responses instead of relevant content from processed documents.

## Context
The document processing pipeline is now functional - documents are being parsed, chunked, and stored successfully. However, when users ask questions about their insurance documents, the system returns generic responses like "No relevant information found in the available documents" instead of providing specific information from the processed content.

## Investigation Phases

### Phase 1: Immediate Analysis
**Objective**: Understand why content retrieval is failing despite successful document processing

**Tasks**:
1. **Analyze Response Generation Flow**
   - Review the query processing pipeline
   - Check content retrieval and search functionality
   - Identify where generic responses are being generated

2. **Examine Document Processing Results**
   - Verify that documents are actually being chunked and stored
   - Check if content is accessible and searchable
   - Validate that parsed content contains relevant information

3. **Database State Analysis**
   - Check document processing status in database
   - Verify that chunks are being created and stored
   - Identify any data inconsistencies

**Deliverables**:
- Response generation flow analysis
- Document processing verification
- Database state summary

### Phase 2: Root Cause Identification
**Objective**: Identify why content retrieval fails despite successful document processing

**Tasks**:
1. **Code Analysis**
   - Review query processing and search logic
   - Check content retrieval implementation
   - Identify hardcoded assumptions or missing logic

2. **Integration Analysis**
   - Review document processing to content retrieval pipeline
   - Check if chunks are properly linked to documents
   - Verify search and retrieval mechanisms

3. **Data Flow Analysis**
   - Trace data flow from document upload to response generation
   - Check for missing or broken connections
   - Identify where the pipeline breaks down

**Deliverables**:
- Root cause analysis report
- Contributing factors list
- Fix design document

### Phase 3: Implementation and Testing
**Objective**: Fix content retrieval and verify relevant responses

**Tasks**:
1. **Code Implementation**
   - Fix content retrieval and search logic
   - Ensure proper document-to-chunk relationships
   - Implement proper response generation

2. **Testing Implementation**
   - Test with real user queries
   - Verify relevant content is retrieved
   - Test various query types and scenarios

3. **Deployment and Verification**
   - Deploy fix to production
   - Test with real user interactions
   - Verify end-to-end functionality
   - Monitor response quality

**Deliverables**:
- Fixed content retrieval code
- Comprehensive test suite
- Deployment verification report
- Response quality monitoring

## Key Files to Investigate

### Primary Files
- `api/` - Query processing and response generation
- `backend/` - Content retrieval and search logic
- `frontend/` - User interface and query handling

### Database Tables
- `upload_pipeline.documents` - Document metadata
- `upload_pipeline.upload_jobs` - Processing status
- Chunk storage tables - Processed content

### Configuration Files
- Search and retrieval configuration
- Response generation settings

## Log Sources

### Production Logs
- **Render API Service**: `srv-d0v2nqvdiees73cejf0g`
- **Render Worker Service**: `srv-d2h5mr8dl3ps73fvvlog`
- **Time Range**: Recent activity after FM-016/017 fixes

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Check document processing status
SELECT 
    d.document_id,
    d.filename,
    d.processing_status,
    d.parsed_path,
    d.parsed_sha256,
    uj.status as job_status,
    uj.state as job_state
FROM upload_pipeline.documents d
JOIN upload_pipeline.upload_jobs uj ON d.document_id = uj.document_id
WHERE d.processing_status = 'parsed'
ORDER BY d.updated_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check if chunks exist
SELECT COUNT(*) as chunk_count
FROM [chunk_table_name]
WHERE document_id IN (
    SELECT document_id 
    FROM upload_pipeline.documents 
    WHERE processing_status = 'parsed'
);
```

## Expected Behavior
- User asks about insurance coverage
- System searches processed document chunks
- Relevant information is retrieved and presented
- Response contains specific details from user's documents

## Actual Behavior
- User asks about insurance coverage
- System returns generic response: "No relevant information found"
- No specific information from processed documents
- Generic template responses regardless of query

## Critical Notes

### Production Environment
- **Service**: insurance-navigator-api.onrender.com
- **Database**: Supabase production
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage
- **Monitoring**: Render logs

### Data Safety
- No data loss risk (documents are processed)
- Content retrieval may be broken
- User experience is degraded

### Rollback Plan
- Revert content retrieval changes if needed
- Database state can be corrected
- No data corruption risk

### Monitoring
- Watch for content retrieval success rates
- Monitor response quality metrics
- Alert on generic response patterns

## Success Criteria

### Immediate Success
- [ ] User queries return relevant information from documents
- [ ] Specific details are retrieved and presented
- [ ] Generic responses are eliminated
- [ ] Content retrieval works end-to-end

### Verification Steps
1. **Test Content Retrieval**
   - Verify documents are searchable
   - Check that chunks contain relevant information
   - Test search functionality

2. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Upload test document
   - Ask specific questions
   - Verify relevant responses
   - Check response quality

3. **Error Handling**
   - Test with various query types
   - Verify error messages are helpful
   - Check graceful degradation

## Tools and Resources

### Available Tools
- Render MCP for production logs and monitoring
- Supabase MCP for database operations
- Terminal for code analysis and testing
- File system access for code review

### External Resources
- Search and retrieval best practices
- Content processing documentation
- Response generation patterns

## Workflow

1. **Start with Response Analysis** - Understand current response generation
2. **Code Review** - Identify content retrieval issues
3. **Root Cause Analysis** - Understand why retrieval fails
4. **Fix Design** - Plan proper content retrieval solution
5. **Implementation** - Code the fix with proper testing
6. **Deployment** - Deploy and verify in production
7. **Monitoring** - Set up response quality monitoring

## Expected Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 30 minutes (immediate analysis)
- **Phase 2**: 45 minutes (root cause and design)
- **Phase 3**: 60 minutes (implementation and testing)
- **Total**: ~2.5 hours

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
- **Data Loss**: Documents are processed, no risk
- **User Experience**: Currently degraded
- **System Downtime**: No risk

### Mitigation Strategies
- Test fixes thoroughly before deployment
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive monitoring
- Create rollback plan
