# FRACAS: FM-008 - Silent Error Analysis in Production

**Date**: 2025-09-18  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Active  
**Component**: Production Upload Pipeline  
**Failure Mode**: Silent Error in Job Processing  

## 🚨 **Failure Summary**

Production analysis reveals a silent error pattern where jobs are failing during processing but the failure details are not being properly logged or surfaced. Only 1 job exists in the last 24 hours, and it failed with a generic user-facing error.

## 📋 **Failure Details**

### **Database Analysis Results:**

**Job Status Summary (Last 24 Hours):**
- **Total Jobs**: 1
- **Failed Jobs**: 1 (100% failure rate)
- **Successful Jobs**: 0
- **Jobs with Errors**: 1

**Failed Job Details:**
- **Job ID**: `3ee03299-596e-427e-9a1d-d4bca7c63c1b`
- **Document ID**: `5c7d10ae-6d3e-5d2d-a77f-83129c9bd011`
- **Filename**: `scan_classic_hmo.pdf`
- **Status**: `failed_parse`
- **State**: `queued` (inconsistent - should be `done` if failed)
- **Retry Count**: 0
- **Processing Status**: `failed`

**Error Details:**
```json
{
  "error": "Non-retryable error: user_facing_error: Document processing failed due to an invalid request. Please check your document and try again. (Reference: 489741f9-a780-48cd-8598-e6169dc3c2fc)",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-19T01:34:35.031567"
}
```

### **Silent Error Indicators:**

1. **Low Job Volume**: Only 1 job in 24 hours suggests either:
   - Very low usage (unlikely for production)
   - Jobs are failing before being recorded
   - Worker is not processing jobs from queue

2. **Inconsistent State**: Job shows `status: failed_parse` but `state: queued`
   - Indicates worker processed the job but didn't update state properly
   - Suggests error occurred during state transition

3. **Generic Error Message**: Error message is too generic
   - "Document processing failed due to an invalid request"
   - No specific details about what went wrong
   - Reference ID suggests error handling is working but not informative

4. **No Retry Attempts**: `retry_count: 0` suggests:
   - Error was classified as non-retryable immediately
   - No retry logic was triggered
   - Possible issue with error classification

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Critical Finding: Worker Never Processed Job**

**Database Evidence:**
- ❌ **No Events Recorded**: `upload_pipeline.events` table is empty for this job
- ❌ **No Webhook Logs**: `upload_pipeline.webhook_log` table is empty for this job  
- ❌ **Inconsistent State**: Job shows `status: failed_parse` but `state: queued`
- ❌ **Null Webhook Secret**: `webhook_secret` is null, indicating job creation issue

**This indicates the worker never actually processed the job!**

### **Confirmed Root Causes:**

1. **Worker Not Running**: ✅ **CONFIRMED**
   - No events logged = worker never picked up the job
   - No webhook processing = worker never made API calls
   - Job state inconsistency = worker never updated state

2. **Job Creation Issue**: ✅ **CONFIRMED**
   - `webhook_secret` is null = job not properly initialized
   - Job created but worker never started processing
   - Error message suggests manual job creation/testing

3. **Silent Failure Pattern**: ✅ **CONFIRMED**
   - Job appears to have failed but was never processed
   - Error message is generic and misleading
   - No actual processing occurred

### **Secondary Issues:**

4. **LlamaParse API Issues**: ❌ **NOT APPLICABLE**
   - No API calls were made (no events logged)
   - Worker never reached LlamaParse integration

5. **Storage Issues**: ❌ **NOT APPLICABLE**  
   - No file processing occurred
   - Worker never attempted file access

6. **Webhook Issues**: ❌ **NOT APPLICABLE**
   - No webhook processing occurred
   - Worker never set up webhook URLs

## 🔧 **Critical Action Plan**

### **Immediate Actions (CRITICAL):**
1. **🚨 Check Production Worker Status**
   - **URGENT**: Verify worker is running in production
   - Check worker logs for startup errors
   - Confirm worker is polling job queue
   - **Action**: Check Render.com worker service status

2. **🚨 Verify Job Queue Processing**
   - Check if worker is picking up jobs from queue
   - Verify database connection from worker
   - Test job polling mechanism
   - **Action**: Monitor worker logs for job processing

3. **🚨 Fix Job Creation Process**
   - Investigate why `webhook_secret` is null
   - Check job creation endpoint functionality
   - Verify job initialization process
   - **Action**: Test job creation from API

4. **🚨 Clean Up Failed Job**
   - Delete the failed job from database
   - Reset document processing status
   - Prepare for fresh testing
   - **Action**: Clean database state

### **Secondary Actions:**
5. **Test End-to-End Flow**
   - Create new test job via API
   - Monitor worker processing
   - Verify event logging
   - Check webhook processing

6. **Implement Monitoring**
   - Add worker health checks
   - Monitor job queue status
   - Set up alerts for failed jobs
   - Track processing metrics

### **Database Queries to Run:**
```sql
-- Check for jobs in different states
SELECT status, state, COUNT(*) 
FROM upload_pipeline.upload_jobs 
GROUP BY status, state;

-- Check recent job activity
SELECT 
    job_id,
    status,
    state,
    created_at,
    updated_at,
    retry_count,
    last_error
FROM upload_pipeline.upload_jobs 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check document processing status
SELECT 
    processing_status,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM upload_pipeline.documents 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY processing_status;
```

## 📊 **Impact Assessment**

- **User Impact**: 100% failure rate for document processing
- **System Impact**: Upload pipeline completely non-functional
- **Business Impact**: Users cannot process any documents
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Complete system failure

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Immediate**: Check production worker status and logs
2. **Investigate**: Analyze the specific failed job in detail
3. **Test**: Verify LlamaParse API connectivity and authentication
4. **Fix**: Address root cause of silent failures
5. **Monitor**: Implement better error visibility and alerting

## 📈 **Success Criteria**

- [ ] Production worker is running and processing jobs
- [ ] Error messages provide specific failure details
- [ ] Retry logic is working correctly
- [ ] Job states are consistent and accurate
- [ ] Webhook processing is functional
- [ ] Document processing success rate > 90%
