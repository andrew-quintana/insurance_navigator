# Investigation Prompt: FM-015 Webhook Processing Failure

## üìã **Current Status**

**FM-015 Status**: IDENTIFIED ‚ùå  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Component**: Webhook Processing Pipeline  

### **Issues Identified** ‚ùå
- **Webhook Processing Failure**: Webhook received but not performing required processing steps
- **Missing Processing Steps**: Webhook not executing expected document processing workflow
- **Pipeline Breakdown**: Document processing pipeline stops after webhook reception

### **Issues Resolved** ‚úÖ
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added comprehensive step-by-step logging to webhook processing function
- **Logging Deployment**: Enhanced logging code deployed to production for investigation

### **Issues Still Pending** ‚ùå
- **Root Cause Unknown**: Need to investigate why webhook processing fails
- **Missing Processing Steps**: Identify which specific steps are not being executed
- **Corrective Action**: Determine and implement fix for webhook processing

## üö® **Critical Success Criteria**

- [ ] **Webhook Reception**: Webhook is being received by API service
- [ ] **Processing Steps**: All required webhook processing steps are executed
- [ ] **Database Updates**: Job status is properly updated in database
- [ ] **Storage Operations**: Parsed content is stored correctly
- [ ] **End-to-End**: Complete document processing pipeline works

## üîç **Initial Observations**

### **What We Know**
- Webhook is being received by API service (confirmed in logs)
- LlamaParse API is successfully processing documents (200 OK responses)
- Database schema is correct and accessible
- Storage operations are working

### **What We Don't Know**
- Which specific processing steps are failing in the webhook
- Why the webhook processing stops after reception
- What error conditions are occurring during processing
- Whether the issue is in database operations, storage operations, or other processing steps

## üîß **Investigation Required**

### **Phase 1: Observation and Logging**
1. **Add Comprehensive Logging**: Add detailed logging to webhook processing function
2. **Monitor Processing Steps**: Track each step of the webhook processing workflow
3. **Error Capture**: Capture and log any errors or exceptions during processing
4. **Database State**: Monitor database state changes during webhook processing

### **Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Step-by-Step Analysis**: Identify which specific step fails
2. **Error Analysis**: Analyze any errors or exceptions captured
3. **State Verification**: Verify database and storage state consistency
4. **Dependency Check**: Check all external dependencies and configurations

### **Phase 3: Corrective Action**
1. **Fix Implementation**: Implement fixes based on root cause findings
2. **Testing**: Verify fixes work with end-to-end testing
3. **Monitoring**: Add monitoring to prevent future occurrences

## üìä **Expected Investigation Results**

### **Logging Should Reveal**
- Exact point of failure in webhook processing
- Error messages and stack traces
- Database operation results
- Storage operation results
- Processing step completion status

### **Root Cause Should Identify**
- Specific failing component or operation
- Configuration issues
- Missing dependencies
- Logic errors in processing workflow

## üîÑ **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy Enhanced Logging**: Add comprehensive logging to webhook processing
2. **Monitor Processing**: Watch webhook processing with detailed logs
3. **Analyze Failures**: Identify specific failure points
4. **Implement Fixes**: Apply corrective actions based on findings
5. **Verify Resolution**: Test complete pipeline functionality

## üìÅ **Files to Investigate**

- `api/upload_pipeline/webhooks.py` - Main webhook processing logic
- `core/database.py` - Database operations
- `backend/shared/storage.py` - Storage operations
- Database schema and RLS policies
- Environment variables and configuration

## üéØ **Success Metrics**

- ‚úÖ Webhook processing completes all required steps
- ‚úÖ Database operations succeed
- ‚úÖ Storage operations succeed
- ‚úÖ Document processing pipeline works end-to-end
- ‚úÖ No errors in webhook processing logs

## üéâ **Resolution Summary**

**FM-015 Status**: PENDING INVESTIGATION

### **Current Status**
- ‚ùå **Webhook Processing**: Failing to complete required processing steps
- ‚ùå **Root Cause**: Unknown - requires investigation
- ‚ùå **Corrective Action**: Pending root cause identification

### **Evidence of Issue**
- Webhook received but processing stops
- Missing expected processing steps
- Pipeline breakdown after webhook reception
