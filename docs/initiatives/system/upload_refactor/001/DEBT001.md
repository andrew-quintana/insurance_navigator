### 6. Security Debt
**Definition**: Security measures that may not meet future compliance or threat requirements

**Items Identified**:
- [ ] **Item 1**: Description of security debt
  - **Impact**: Security risk or compliance gap
  - **Rationale**: Why security was implemented this way
  - **Mitigation**: How to improve security posture
  - **Priority**: High/Medium/Low

## Debt Management Strategy

### Immediate Actions (Next 30 days)
- [ ] Review and validate all identified debt items
- [ ] Prioritize debt items by impact and effort
- [ ] Create debt reduction roadmap

### Short-term Actions (Next 90 days)
- [ ] Address high-priority debt items
- [ ] Implement debt monitoring and tracking
- [ ] Establish debt prevention practices

### Long-term Actions (Next 6 months)
- [ ] Systematic debt reduction program
- [ ] Architecture review and debt assessment
- [ ] Technical debt budget planning

## Debt Prevention Measures

### Development Practices
- [ ] Code review requirements for debt identification
- [ ] Architecture decision record (ADR) process
- [ ] Technical debt tracking in project management

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Debt assessment in phase completion criteria
- [ ] Technical debt limits in acceptance criteria
- [ ] Regular debt review meetings

### Documentation Standards
- [ ] Technical debt documentation requirements
- [ ] Debt impact assessment templates
- [ ] Debt mitigation planning documentation

## Conclusion

This document serves as a living record of technical debt accumulated during the project. It should be:

1. **Updated regularly** as new debt is identified
2. **Reviewed at phase completion** to assess debt accumulation
3. **Used for planning** future development cycles
4. **Shared with stakeholders** to inform technical decisions

**Next Review**: Phase 3 completion  
**Responsible Party**: Development Team  
**Approval**: Technical Lead / Engineering Director
