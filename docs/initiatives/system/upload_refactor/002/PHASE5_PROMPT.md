# Phase 5 Execution Prompt: Implementation Investigation & Root Cause Analysis

## Context
You are implementing Phase 5 of the 002 Worker Refactor iteration. This phase was added after Phase 4 revealed critical implementation issues that require investigation and root cause analysis before proceeding.

## Documentation References
Please review these documents before starting investigation:
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/002/TODO002.md` - Updated checklist with Phase 5 investigation tasks
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/002/CONTEXT002.md` - Expected architecture and behavior
- `@TODO002_phase4_notes.md` - Phase 4 implementation and testing results
- `@TODO002_phase4_testing_summary.md` - Final validation results showing issues
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/002/MIGRATION_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` - Migration procedures (if exists)
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/002/MIGRATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Migration reference (if exists)

## Primary Objective
Investigate critical implementation failures and perform root cause analysis including:
1. Current state investigation of database, Supabase, and Render infrastructure
2. Root cause analysis of specific failures (wrong dates, empty processing, missing chunks)
3. Infrastructure assessment to identify configuration and deployment issues
4. Test execution analysis to understand what actually happened vs. what was reported
5. **Define Phase 6 and Phase 7 requirements** based on investigation findings

## Critical Issues Identified
Phase 4 revealed these critical problems that need investigation:
- **Wrong dates**: Documents showing August 6th instead of August 16th
- **Empty processing**: All documents show "Empty" status
- **No chunks**: Document chunks table is empty
- **Impossible batch processing**: All documents processed in 1 minute
- **Missing Render worker**: No worker configured in Render account

## Key Investigation Requirements

### Database Investigation
- Check current migration status using `npx supabase migration list`
- Analyze database schema state and verify buffer tables exist
- Investigate data inconsistencies (creation dates, processing status)
- Verify if 001 migration was properly rolled back and 002 migration is active

### Supabase Configuration Analysis
- Verify storage bucket configuration (raw/parsed buckets exist and accessible)
- Analyze RLS policies and security configuration
- Review environment configuration (URLs, service role keys, API keys)
- Test bucket access and operations

### Render Deployment Assessment
- Check Render service status and configuration
- Investigate worker configuration and processes
- Analyze deployment configuration and logs
- Verify service dependencies and connectivity

### Test Execution Review
- Analyze what tests were actually executed vs. what was reported
- Check test data and timestamps for inconsistencies
- Investigate why Phase 4 was marked complete despite failures
- Document actual vs. expected system behavior

## Expected Outputs
Document your investigation in these files:
- `@TODO002_phase5_investigation.md` - Detailed investigation notes and findings
- `@TODO002_phase5_root_causes.md` - Root cause analysis for each identified issue
- `@TODO002_phase5_fixes_required.md` - Comprehensive list of fixes needed
- `@TODO002_phase5_current_state.md` - Current state assessment of all systems
- `@TODO002_phase5_phase6_definition.md` - **Define Phase 6 requirements and tasks**
- `@TODO002_phase5_phase7_definition.md` - **Define Phase 7 requirements and tasks**

## Success Criteria
- All critical issues have identified root causes
- Current state of database, Supabase, and Render infrastructure is documented
- Specific fixes required are clearly defined and prioritized
- Phase 6 and Phase 7 requirements are defined with detailed task breakdowns
- Investigation provides clear path forward for completing the 002 implementation

## Implementation Notes
- Use the detailed investigation checklist in TODO002.md Phase 5 section
- Focus on fact-finding rather than fixing issues (that's for Phase 6)
- Document everything you discover, even if it seems unrelated
- Be thorough in checking actual system state vs. expected state
- **Critical**: Phase 6 and Phase 7 success depends on the quality of this investigation
- The investigation should reveal why the 002 implementation appeared to work but actually failed

## Investigation Approach
1. **Start with database state**: Check migrations, schema, and data
2. **Verify infrastructure**: Supabase storage, Render deployment, worker configuration
3. **Analyze test execution**: What really happened during Phase 4 testing
4. **Document findings**: Create comprehensive documentation for next phases
5. **Define next phases**: Based on findings, clearly define Phase 6 and Phase 7 requirements

This investigation is critical for the success of the entire 002 Worker Refactor. Take your time to be thorough and accurate in your analysis.
