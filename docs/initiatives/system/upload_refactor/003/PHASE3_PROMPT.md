# Phase 3 Execution Prompt: Enhanced BaseWorker Implementation

## Context
You are implementing Phase 3 of the 003 Worker Refactor iteration. This phase implements the enhanced BaseWorker with comprehensive monitoring, logging, and local validation, building upon the local environment and infrastructure validation framework from previous phases.

## Documentation References
Please review these documents before starting implementation:
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/CONTEXT003.md` - Enhanced BaseWorker architecture and state machine implementation
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TODO003.md` - Detailed implementation checklist (Phase 3 section)
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/RFC003.md` - Technical design for BaseWorker with comprehensive monitoring
- `TODO003_phase2_notes.md` - Phase 2 infrastructure validation framework implementation
- `TODO003_phase2_decisions.md` - Previous infrastructure validation decisions
- `TODO003_phase2_handoff.md` - BaseWorker implementation requirements from Phase 2
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/002/CONTEXT002.md` - Original BaseWorker architecture foundation

## Primary Objective
**IMPLEMENT** the enhanced BaseWorker with comprehensive monitoring and state machine processing as specified in the documentation. All implementation requirements, technical specifications, and detailed checklists are defined in the referenced documents.

## Expected Outputs
Document your work in these files:
- `TODO003_phase3_notes.md` - BaseWorker implementation details and processing patterns
- `TODO003_phase3_decisions.md` - Processing architecture decisions and trade-offs
- `TODO003_phase3_handoff.md` - Local validation requirements for Phase 4
- `TODO003_phase3_testing_summary.md` - Performance testing results and optimization findings

## Implementation Approach
1. **Read all documentation thoroughly** - Review CONTEXT003.md sections 8-9, RFC003.md BaseWorker sections, TODO003.md Phase 3, CONTEXT002.md, and previous phase outputs
2. **Follow the detailed checklist** - Use TODO003.md Phase 3 section as your step-by-step implementation guide
3. **Reference technical specifications** - Use RFC003.md and CONTEXT003.md for BaseWorker architecture and monitoring design
4. **Build upon previous phases** - Use local environment and infrastructure validation framework from Phases 1-2

Start by reading all referenced documentation and previous phase outputs, then implement the enhanced BaseWorker following the detailed Phase 3 checklist and comprehensive validation requirements.
