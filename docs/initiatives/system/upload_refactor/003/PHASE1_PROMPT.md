# Phase 1 Execution Prompt: Local Development Environment Setup

## Context
You are implementing Phase 1 of the 003 Worker Refactor iteration. This phase establishes the foundation for local-first development with Docker-based complete pipeline replication, addressing critical gaps identified in the 002 post-mortem analysis.

## Documentation References
Please review these documents before starting implementation:
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/CONTEXT003.md` - Complete architecture overview and local development approach
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TODO003.md` - Detailed implementation checklist (Phase 1 section)
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/PRD003.md` - Requirements and success criteria for local environment
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/RFC003.md` - Technical design for Docker-based development environment
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/002/POSTMORTEM002.md` - Lessons learned from 002 failures

## Primary Objective
**IMPLEMENT** the complete Docker-based local development environment as specified in the documentation. All implementation requirements, technical specifications, and detailed checklists are defined in the referenced documents.

## Expected Outputs
Document your work in these files:
- `@TODO003_phase1_notes.md` - Environment implementation details and technical decisions
- `@TODO003_phase1_decisions.md` - Technical choices, trade-offs, and rationale
- `@TODO003_phase1_handoff.md` - Infrastructure validation requirements for Phase 2
- `@TODO003_phase1_testing_summary.md` - Local testing results and performance benchmarks

## Implementation Approach
1. **Read all documentation thoroughly** - Review CONTEXT003.md, RFC003.md, TODO003.md Phase 1, and PRD003.md
2. **Follow the detailed checklist** - Use TODO003.md Phase 1 section as your step-by-step implementation guide
3. **Reference technical specifications** - Use RFC003.md for Docker architecture and technical design
4. **Meet success criteria** - Ensure all requirements in PRD003.md are satisfied

Start by reading all referenced documentation thoroughly, then implement the complete local development environment following the detailed Phase 1 checklist and validation requirements.
