# Phase 1 Execution Prompt: Local Development Environment Setup

## Context
You are implementing Phase 1 of the 003 Worker Refactor iteration. This phase establishes the foundation for local-first development with Docker-based complete pipeline replication, addressing critical gaps identified in the 002 post-mortem analysis.

## Documentation References
Please review these documents before starting implementation:
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/CONTEXT003.md` - Complete architecture overview and local development approach
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TODO003.md` - Detailed implementation checklist (Phase 1 section)
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/PRD003.md` - Requirements and success criteria for local environment
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/RFC003.md` - Technical design for Docker-based development environment
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/002/POSTMORTEM002.md` - Lessons learned from 002 failures

## Primary Objective
Implement complete Docker-based local development environment including:
1. Docker compose configuration for complete processing pipeline
2. Local database setup with vector extensions and buffer tables
3. Mock service implementation for external API dependencies
4. Local monitoring and health check systems

## Key Implementation Requirements

### Docker Environment Foundation
- Create comprehensive docker-compose.yml for complete pipeline
- Implement Postgres with pgvector extension and buffer table support
- Set up Supabase local storage simulation
- Configure local API server and BaseWorker containers with proper networking

### Mock Service Implementation
- Create mock LlamaParse service with realistic webhook callback simulation
- Implement mock OpenAI service with deterministic embedding generation
- Develop mock service coordination with configurable timing and error injection
- Build external service integration testing framework

### Local Environment Scripts
- Develop automated setup script completing environment initialization in <30 minutes
- Create health check validation for all local services
- Implement comprehensive testing script executing end-to-end pipeline validation in <5 minutes
- Build troubleshooting and debugging utilities for development

### Local Monitoring and Observability
- Set up local monitoring dashboard for real-time processing pipeline health
- Implement structured logging and metrics collection with correlation IDs
- Create alerting system for local development failures and bottlenecks
- Develop performance monitoring and optimization identification tools

## Expected Outputs
Document your work in these files:
- `@TODO003_phase1_notes.md` - Environment implementation details and technical decisions
- `@TODO003_phase1_decisions.md` - Technical choices, trade-offs, and rationale
- `@TODO003_phase1_handoff.md` - Infrastructure validation requirements for Phase 2
- `@TODO003_phase1_testing_summary.md` - Local testing results and performance benchmarks

## Success Criteria
- Complete Docker environment starts successfully and passes all health checks in <30 minutes
- Local end-to-end pipeline test completes successfully in <5 minutes
- All services integrated and communicating with proper networking and dependency management
- Mock services provide realistic simulation of external API behavior with deterministic results
- Local monitoring provides real-time visibility into processing pipeline health
- Environment setup is reproducible across different development machines

## Implementation Notes
- Use the detailed checklist in TODO003.md Phase 1 section as your implementation guide
- Follow the Docker compose architecture specified in RFC003.md
- Implement deterministic mock services for consistent testing across environments
- Focus on local environment reliability and development velocity optimization
- Ensure all services have proper health checks and monitoring integration
- Document any deviations from planned architecture and rationale

## Critical Validation Points
- **Environment Setup Time**: Complete pipeline operational in <30 minutes
- **Test Execution Speed**: End-to-end validation completes in <5 minutes
- **Service Health**: All services pass health checks and communicate properly
- **Mock Service Integration**: External service simulation provides realistic behavior
- **Local Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into processing pipeline status
- **Reproducibility**: Environment setup succeeds consistently across machines

Start by reading all referenced documentation thoroughly, then implement the complete local development environment following the detailed Phase 1 checklist and validation requirements.
