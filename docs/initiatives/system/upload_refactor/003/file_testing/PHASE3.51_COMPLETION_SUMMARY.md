- **PHASE3.6_PROMPT.md**: Updated scope to focus on embedding completion
- **PHASE3.7_PROMPT.md**: Updated scope to focus on end-to-end validation
- **Progress Metrics**: Updated to reflect actual completion status

### 4. **Phase Scope Restructuring** ✅

- **Phase 4**: End-to-end workflow validation and integration testing (as originally planned)
- **Eliminated Redundancy**: No duplicate validation of already-completed stages

## Implementation Reality vs. Original Plan

### **Original Phase Plan**
```
Phase 3.5: parse_validated → chunking
Phase 3.6: chunking → chunks_buffered  
Phase 3.7: chunks_buffered → embedding
Phase 3.8: embedding → embedded
Phase 3.9: End-to-End Pipeline Validation
```

### **Actual Implementation (Phase 3.5)**
```
Phase 3.5: parse_validated → chunking → chunks_buffered → embedding
   - Single method call advanced through multiple database stages
   - More efficient implementation than originally planned
   - Automatically completed work of phases 3.6 and 3.7
```

### **Refactored Phase Structure (Post-3.51)**
```
✅ Phase 3.5: parse_validated → embedding (COMPLETED - includes multiple stages)
🔄 Phase 3.6: embedding → embedded (embedding completion focus)
🔄 Phase 3.7: embedded → completion (end-to-end validation focus)
➡️ Phase 4: End-to-End Workflow Validation and Integration Testing
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### **Root Cause Analysis**
The `_process_chunks()` method in `base_worker.py` performs the complete chunking workflow atomically:

1. **Stage 1**: `parse_validated` → reads parsed content
2. **Stage 2**: `chunking` → generates chunks using markdown-simple chunker  
3. **Stage 3**: `chunks_buffered` → stores chunks in `document_chunk_buffer` table
4. **Stage 4**: `embedding` → automatically advances to embedding stage

### **Implementation Efficiency**
- **Planning Assumption**: Each stage transition would be a separate validation phase
- **Implementation Reality**: Worker processes multiple stage transitions atomically
- **Code Behavior**: Single method call advances through multiple database stages
- **Result**: Phases 3.6 and 3.7 became redundant as already completed in 3.5

### **Database State Verification**
```sql
-- Current system state after Phase 3.5 completion
SELECT stage, COUNT(*) FROM upload_pipeline.upload_jobs GROUP BY stage;

embedding: 1 job    (successfully advanced through chunking stages)
queued: 1 job       (awaiting processing)
Total:   2 jobs

-- Chunks successfully generated and stored (from 3.5)
SELECT COUNT(*) as chunk_count FROM upload_pipeline.document_chunk_buffer;
chunk_count: 5 chunks
```
