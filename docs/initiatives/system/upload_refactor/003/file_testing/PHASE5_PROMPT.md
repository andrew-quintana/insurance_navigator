docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs base-worker --tail=20
```

### Step 2: API Service Assessment
```bash
# Identify required API integrations
python scripts/assess-api-requirements.py

# Document API specifications and authentication
python scripts/document-api-specs.py

# Analyze API rate limits and usage patterns
python scripts/analyze-api-constraints.py
```

### Step 3: API Implementation
```bash
# Implement API client connections
python scripts/implement-api-clients.py

# Integrate API calls into processing pipeline
python scripts/integrate-api-pipeline.py

# Configure API authentication and settings
python scripts/configure-api-settings.py
```

### Step 4: Integration Testing
```bash
# Test API connectivity and authentication
python scripts/test-api-connectivity.py

# Validate data flow integration
python scripts/test-api-data-flow.py

# Test error scenarios and edge cases
python scripts/test-api-error-scenarios.py
```

### Step 5: Error Handling Implementation
```bash
# Implement comprehensive API error handling
python scripts/implement-api-error-handling.py

# Add retry logic and circuit breakers

```

### Step 6: API Integration Validation
```sql
-- Monitor API integration status
SELECT 
    api_name,
    status,
    last_successful_call,
    error_count,
    avg_response_time
FROM api_integration_status 
WHERE last_check >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY api_name;

-- Check API call success rates
SELECT 
    api_endpoint,
    COUNT(*) as total_calls,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful_calls,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate
FROM api_call_logs 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY api_endpoint;

-- Verify direct-write architecture data flow
SELECT d.document_id, d.filename, uj.stage, uj.updated_at,
       dc.chunk_count, dc.embedding_count
FROM upload_pipeline.documents d
JOIN upload_pipeline.upload_jobs uj ON d.document_id = uj.document_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT document_id, 
           COUNT(*) as chunk_count,
           COUNT(CASE WHEN embedding IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as embedding_count
    FROM upload_pipeline.document_chunks
    GROUP BY document_id
) dc ON d.document_id = dc.document_id
WHERE uj.stage = 'embedded'
ORDER BY uj.updated_at DESC;
