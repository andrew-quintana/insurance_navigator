## Testing Procedures

### Step 1: Phase 4 Handoff Review
```bash
# REQUIRED: Review Phase 4 handoff notes
cat docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/TODO001_phase4_handoff.md

# Verify current system state matches handoff expectations
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs base-worker --tail=20
```

### Step 2: Performance Baseline Establishment
```bash
# Establish performance baselines for all stages
python scripts/establish-performance-baselines.py

# Measure current response times and throughput
python scripts/measure-performance-metrics.py

# Document resource usage patterns
python scripts/analyze-resource-usage.py
```

### Step 3: Bottleneck Identification
```bash
# Analyze performance data for bottlenecks
python scripts/identify-bottlenecks.py

# Profile database query performance
python scripts/profile-database-performance.py

# Analyze worker processing efficiency
python scripts/analyze-worker-efficiency.py
```

### Step 4: Optimization Implementation
```bash
# Implement database optimizations
python scripts/implement-database-optimizations.py

# Optimize worker processing logic
python scripts/optimize-worker-processing.py

# Implement caching strategies
python scripts/implement-caching.py
```

### Step 5: Scaling Validation
```bash
# Test system performance under increased load
python scripts/test-scaling.py --load-factor=2.0

# Validate concurrent processing capabilities
python scripts/test-concurrent-scaling.py --concurrent=10

# Test resource scaling and management
python scripts/test-resource-scaling.py
```

### Step 6: Performance Validation
```sql
-- Monitor performance metrics
SELECT stage, 
       AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (updated_at - created_at))) as avg_processing_time,
       COUNT(*) as job_count
FROM upload_pipeline.upload_jobs 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY stage 
ORDER BY stage;

-- Check resource utilization
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';
```
