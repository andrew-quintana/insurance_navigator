- **Performance Testing**: Test embedding generation performance without API rate limits

#### **Implementation**
```python
class MockServiceRouter:
    async def generate_embeddings(self, texts: List[str], job_id: str) -> List[List[float]]:
        """Generate mock embeddings for testing"""
        embeddings = []
        for i, text in enumerate(texts):
            # Generate deterministic mock embedding based on text content
            embedding = self._generate_mock_embedding(text, i)
            embeddings.append(embedding)
        return embeddings
    
    def _generate_mock_embedding(self, text: str, index: int) -> List[float]:
        """Generate deterministic mock embedding vector"""
        # Create deterministic embedding based on text content
        text_hash = hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()
        seed = int(text_hash[:8], 16) + index
        
        # Generate 1536-dimensional vector (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
        random.seed(seed)
        embedding = [random.uniform(-1, 1) for _ in range(1536)]
        
        # Normalize to unit vector
        magnitude = sum(x*x for x in embedding) ** 0.5
        normalized = [x/magnitude for x in embedding]
        
        return normalized
```

        # Normalize query for pattern matching (remove newlines and extra whitespace)
        normalized_query = " ".join(query.split())
        
        if "SELECT chunk_id, text, chunk_sha FROM upload_pipeline.document_chunk_buffer" in normalized_query:
            document_id = args[0] if args else None
            if document_id:
                # Filter chunks by document_id
                filtered_chunks = [chunk for chunk in self.chunks if chunk["document_id"] == document_id]
                return filtered_chunks
        return []
    
    def execute(self, query: str, *args):
        """Mock execute method for stage updates"""
        if "UPDATE upload_pipeline.upload_jobs SET stage = 'embedded'" in query:
            job_id = args[0] if args else None
            if job_id:
                # Update job stage to embedded
                for job in self.jobs:
                    if job["job_id"] == job_id:
                        job["stage"] = "embedded"
                        return True
        return True
```

        return self.db.execute(query, *args)
    
    def fetch(self, query: str, *args):
        return self.db.fetch(query, *args)
    
    async def __aenter__(self):
        return self
    
    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        pass
```

#### **Outcome**

# Update job stage to embedded
async with self.db.get_db_connection() as conn:
    conn.execute("""
        UPDATE upload_pipeline.upload_jobs
        SET stage = 'embedded', updated_at = now()
        WHERE job_id = $1
    """, job_id)
    
    # Also update the job object in memory for validation
    job["stage"] = "embedded"
    job["updated_at"] = datetime.utcnow()
    
    print(f"✅ Job stage updated to 'embedded' in database and memory")
```

#### **Outcome**

#### **Implementation**
```python
# Test chunk retrieval failures
if not chunks:
    raise ValueError("No chunks found for embedding")

# Test embedding generation failures
if len(embeddings) != len(chunks):
    raise ValueError(f"Expected {len(chunks)} embeddings, got {len(embeddings)}")

# Test vector storage failures with conflict resolution
ON CONFLICT (chunk_id, embed_model, embed_version) 
DO UPDATE SET vector = $5, vector_sha = $6, created_at = now()
```

#### **Outcome**
✅ **SUCCESS**: Comprehensive error scenario testing validated all error handling mechanisms, ensuring robust error recovery and monitoring capabilities.

duration = (datetime.utcnow() - start_time).total_seconds()

# Log performance metrics
self.logger.log_external_service_call(
    service="openai",
    operation="generate_embeddings",
    duration_ms=duration * 1000,
    job_id=str(job_id),

    seed = int(text_hash[:8], 16) + index
    
    # Generate 1536-dimensional vector (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
    import random
    random.seed(seed)
    
    # Generate values between -1 and 1
    embedding = [random.uniform(-1, 1) for _ in range(1536)]
    
    # Normalize to unit vector
    magnitude = sum(x*x for x in embedding) ** 0.5
    normalized = [x/magnitude for x in embedding]
