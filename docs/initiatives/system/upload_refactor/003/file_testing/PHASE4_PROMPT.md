# Phase 4 Execution Prompt: End-to-End Workflow Validation and Integration Testing

## Context
You are implementing Phase 4 of the upload refactor 003 file testing initiative. This phase focuses on comprehensive end-to-end workflow validation and integration testing, building upon the completed Phase 3 sub-phases to ensure the complete processing pipeline works seamlessly from upload to completion.

## Documentation References
Please review these documents before starting implementation:

## Primary Objective
**VALIDATE** the complete end-to-end workflow by testing the full document processing pipeline from upload through all 9 processing stages to completion, ensuring seamless integration and performance under realistic conditions.

## Expected Outputs
