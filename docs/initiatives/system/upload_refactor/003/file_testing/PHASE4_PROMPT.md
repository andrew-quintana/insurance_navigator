docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs base-worker --tail=20
```

### Step 2: All Stages Verification
```bash
# Verify all processing stages are operational
python scripts/verify-all-stages.py

# Check stage transition readiness

# Validate stage dependencies and prerequisites
python scripts/validate-stage-dependencies.py
```

### Step 3: Complete Workflow Testing
```bash
# Test complete document processing workflow
python scripts/test-complete-workflow.py

# Monitor all processing stages in real-time
docker-compose logs -f base-worker api-server

# Validate stage transition timing and coordination
python scripts/validate-stage-coordination.py
```

### Step 4: Integration Testing
```bash
# Test stage integration and data flow
python scripts/test-stage-integration.py

# Validate data integrity between stages
python scripts/validate-data-integrity.py

# Test pipeline resilience and error handling

```

### Step 5: Concurrent Processing Testing
```bash
# Test concurrent document processing
python scripts/test-concurrent-processing.py --concurrent=3

GROUP BY stage 
ORDER BY stage;

-- Verify complete data flow
SELECT d.document_id, d.filename, uj.stage, uj.updated_at,
       dc.chunk_count, dvb.embedding_count
FROM upload_pipeline.documents d
JOIN upload_pipeline.upload_jobs uj ON d.document_id = uj.document_id
