# Phase 3.7 Execution Prompt: chunks_stored â†’ embedding_queued Transition Validation

## Context
You are implementing Phase 3.7 of the upload refactor 003 file testing initiative. This phase focuses on validating the automatic transition from `chunks_stored` to `embedding_queued` stage, building upon the successful chunking completion implementation from Phase 3.6.

## Documentation References
Please review these documents before starting implementation:
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/TODO001.md` - Phase 3.7 requirements and tasks
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/TEST_METHOD001.md` - Testing methodology and procedures
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/TODO001_phase3.6_handoff.md` - **REQUIRED**: Phase 3.6 handoff notes and requirements
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/PHASE3_SCOPE_UPDATE.md` - Phase 3 scope and objectives

## Primary Objective
**VALIDATE** the automatic transition from `chunks_stored` to `embedding_queued` stage by ensuring the worker process successfully queues jobs for embedding and advances them to the next stage.

## Expected Outputs
Document your work in these files:
- `TODO001_phase3.7_notes.md` - Phase 3.7 implementation details and validation results
- `TODO001_phase3.7_decisions.md` - Technical decisions and embedding queue approaches
- `TODO001_phase3.7_handoff.md` - **REQUIRED**: Comprehensive handoff notes for Phase 3.8 transition
- `TODO001_phase3.7_testing_summary.md` - Phase 3.7 testing results and status

## Implementation Approach
1. **Review Phase 3.6 Handoff**: **REQUIRED**: Read and understand all Phase 3.6 handoff requirements
2. **Verify Current System State**: Confirm chunking completion and database state from Phase 3.6
3. **Test Embedding Queue Processing**: Validate worker handles `chunks_stored` stage jobs automatically
4. **Validate Embedding Queue Logic**: Test embedding queue preparation and setup logic
5. **Confirm Stage Transitions**: Verify jobs advance from `chunks_stored` to `embedding_queued` stage
6. **Document Results**: Record all findings and prepare for Phase 3.8
7. **Create Handoff Notes**: **REQUIRED**: Document complete handoff requirements for next phase

- **Database Infrastructure**: âœ… PostgreSQL operational with correct schema
- **BaseWorker Implementation**: âœ… Enhanced with comprehensive monitoring
- **Environment Configuration**: âœ… Docker Compose stack fully operational

## Technical Focus Areas

### 1. Embedding Queue Processing
- Validate `_process_chunks_stored()` method implementation
- Test embedding queue logic execution
- Verify stage transition database updates
- Check for any missing dependencies or imports

### 2. Embedding Queue Logic
- Test embedding queue preparation and setup
- Validate embedding configuration and parameters
- Verify embedding strategy selection
- Test error handling for embedding queue failures

### 3. Database State Management
- Monitor job stage transitions in real-time
- Validate database update operations during embedding queue setup
- Check for any constraint violations
- Verify transaction management

## Testing Procedures

### Step 1: Phase 3.6 Handoff Review
```bash
# REQUIRED: Review Phase 3.6 handoff notes
cat docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/TODO001_phase3.6_handoff.md

# Verify current system state matches handoff expectations
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs base-worker --tail=20
```

### Step 2: Environment Verification
```bash
# Check worker service status
docker-compose ps base-worker

# Check worker logs for embedding queue activity
docker-compose logs base-worker --tail=50

# Verify chunks_stored stage jobs exist
docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f name=postgres) psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "SELECT stage, COUNT(*) FROM upload_pipeline.upload_jobs GROUP BY stage;"
```

### Step 3: Embedding Queue Stage Validation
```bash
# Monitor worker processing in real-time
docker-compose logs base-worker -f

# Check database for stage transitions
# Monitor for automatic embedding queue processing
```

### Step 4: Embedding Queue Logic Testing
```bash
# Test embedding queue logic
# Verify embedding queue preparation and setup
# Test error handling for embedding queue failures
```

### Step 5: Stage Transition Validation
```sql
-- Monitor job stage changes
SELECT job_id, stage, updated_at
FROM upload_pipeline.upload_jobs 
WHERE stage IN ('chunks_stored', 'embedding_queued')
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Success Scenario
- Worker automatically processes `chunks_stored` stage jobs
- Jobs transition from `chunks_stored` to `embedding_queued` stage
- Embedding queue logic working correctly

### Failure Scenarios
- Worker not processing `chunks_stored` stage jobs
