# TODO001 — Upload Refactor 003 File Testing

## Phase 0 — Context Harvest
- [x] Review adjacent components in CONTEXT.md
- [x] Update ADJACENT_INDEX.md with current dates
- [x] Collect interface contracts from adjacent systems
- [x] Validate token budget allocation
- [x] Block: Implementation cannot proceed until Phase 0 complete

## Phase 1 — Planning
- [x] Complete TEST_METHOD001.md
- [ ] Review upload refactor 003 implementation details
- [ ] Identify test file specifications and requirements
- [ ] Map database schema for verification
- [ ] Define bucket structure and naming conventions
- [ ] Establish baseline metrics and acceptance criteria

## Phase 2 — Environment Preparation
- [ ] Verify Supabase connection and authentication
- [ ] Confirm upload service endpoint availability
- [ ] Validate bucket permissions and access
- [ ] Set up database query tools and access
- [ ] Prepare test document inventory
- [ ] Document pre-test system state

## Phase 3 — Test Execution
- [ ] Execute upload test for simulated_insurance_document.pdf
- [ ] Capture upload response metadata and timing
- [ ] Execute upload test for scan_classic_hmo_parsed.pdf
- [ ] Capture upload response metadata and timing
- [ ] Document any errors or unexpected behaviors
- [ ] Record performance metrics

## Phase 4 — Verification & Validation
- [ ] Query database for created records
- [ ] Verify file metadata accuracy (size, type, timestamps)
- [ ] Confirm bucket storage locations and paths
- [ ] Test file accessibility via generated URLs
- [ ] Validate file integrity (checksums, content verification)
- [ ] Cross-reference upload responses with database entries

## Phase 5 — Documentation & Reporting
- [ ] Generate visual inspection links for manual verification
- [ ] Create verification report with test results
- [ ] Document discovered issues or anomalies
- [ ] Update traceability matrix with actual results
- [ ] Prepare stakeholder summary
- [ ] Archive test artifacts and evidence

## Phase 6 — Post-Test Activities
- [ ] Clean up test data if required
- [ ] Update system documentation based on findings
- [ ] Recommend improvements or fixes
- [ ] Schedule follow-up testing if needed
- [ ] Mark initiative testing phase complete

## Blockers
- Database access credentials or permissions
- Upload service availability or configuration issues
- Network connectivity to Supabase infrastructure
- Test document availability or corruption

## Notes
- Test documents:
  - `simulated_insurance_document.pdf` (1.7KB) - Small document for basic validation
  - `scan_classic_hmo_parsed.pdf` (2.4MB) - Larger document for capacity testing
- Focus on end-to-end validation rather than unit testing
- Visual inspection links critical for stakeholder confidence
- Database record verification must include all expected fields
- Bucket path validation essential for downstream processing

## Risk Mitigation
- Backup test environment state before execution
- Document rollback procedures for any test data
- Maintain audit trail of all test activities
- Establish communication channel for real-time issue reporting

## Success Criteria
- Both test documents upload successfully
- Database records created with complete metadata
- Files accessible in correct bucket locations
- Visual inspection links functional
- Zero data integrity issues identified
- Complete documentation package delivered
