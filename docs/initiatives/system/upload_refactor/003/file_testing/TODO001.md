## Phase 3 — Database Flow Verification and Processing Outcomes

### Expected Processing State Flow
```
queued → job_validated → parsing → parsed → parse_validated → chunking → chunks_buffered → embedding → embedded
```

### Job Status Definitions
- **queued**: Initial state when job is first created. Document has been uploaded and a job has been enqueued for processing.
- **job_validated**: Confirmed via hash not to be a dupe upload, proceeds to this state to confirm it needs processing
- **parsing**: Document is actively being processed by the parser (e.g., LlamaParse) to extract text and structure.
- **parsed**: Parser has completed processing and returned results via webhook, but results haven't been validated yet.
- **parse_validated**: Parsed content has been validated (format, completeness, uniqueness in blob storage) and is ready for chunking.
- **chunking**: System is actively dividing the parsed document into semantic chunks for embedding and deduped via hashing.
- **chunks_buffered**: All chunks have been created and stored in the appropriate table but not yet committed to the main chunks table.
- **embedding**: System is actively generating vector embeddings for the document chunks in the buffer table. (As each row is embedded written to the `document_chunks` table (with hashing deduping) it is removed from the buffer table.
- **embedded**: All embeddings have been successfully written to the appropriate chunks and the chunks have been moved from the buffer to the `document_chunks` table. The table is ready for rag operations.

## Blockers
- Database access credentials or permissions
- Upload service availability or configuration issues
- Network connectivity to Supabase infrastructure
- Test document availability or corruption
- Worker process automation issues (currently manual only)

## Notes
- Test documents:
  - `test_document.pdf` (63 bytes) - Successfully uploaded and stored in Phase 2.1
  - Additional test documents can be created as needed for database flow testing
- **IMPORTANT**: Using postgres database (not accessa_dev) for all testing
- Focus on database processing pipeline validation and end-to-end workflow testing
- Processing state flow: queued → job_validated → parsing → parsed → parse_validated → chunking → chunks_buffered → embedding → embedded
- Visual inspection links critical for stakeholder confidence
- Database record verification must include all expected fields and relationships
- Processing state progression validation essential for downstream processing
- State transitions must be properly logged in events table
- Chunking and embedding processes must be validated through buffer and final tables
- Performance metrics should be captured for each processing stage
- Worker automation is critical for Phase 3.2+ completion

## Risk Mitigation
- Backup test environment state before execution
- Document rollback procedures for any test data
- Maintain audit trail of all test activities
- Establish communication channel for real-time issue reporting
- Monitor API costs during real API testing phases
