## üîß **Current System Configuration**

### **Enhanced Worker Configuration**
```bash
# Service Configuration
SERVICE_MODE=HYBRID
LLAMAPARSE_API_URL=https://api.cloud.llamaindex.ai
OPENAI_API_URL=https://api.openai.com

# Cost Management
DAILY_COST_LIMIT_OPENAI=5.00
HOURLY_RATE_LIMIT_OPENAI=100
COST_TRACKING_ENABLED=true
```

### **Service Status**
- **Enhanced Worker**: ‚úÖ **OPERATIONAL** - Ready to process jobs
- **Service Router**: ‚úÖ **OPERATIONAL** - Supporting all service modes
- **Real Services**: ‚úÖ **CONNECTED** - LlamaParse and OpenAI APIs accessible
- **Cost Management**: ‚úÖ **OPERATIONAL** - Budget limits and tracking active
- **Health Monitoring**: ‚úÖ **OPERATIONAL** - Automatic fallback mechanisms working

### **Infrastructure Status**
- **Database**: ‚úÖ **HEALTHY** - PostgreSQL operational with connection pooling
- **Storage**: ‚úÖ **HEALTHY** - Local storage service operational
- **API Server**: ‚úÖ **HEALTHY** - FastAPI server running and accessible
- **Docker Services**: ‚úÖ **HEALTHY** - All containers operational

## üìä **Testing Resources Available**

### **Test Documents**
- `examples/simulated_insurance_document.pdf` - Small test document (1.7KB)
- `examples/test_serverless_processing.txt` - Text-based test document
- `examples/scan_classic_hmo.pdf` - Larger test document (2.4MB)

### **API Endpoints Available**
- **Health Check**: `GET /health` - System health status
- **Upload API**: `POST /api/v2/upload` - Document upload (requires authentication)
- **Test Upload**: `POST /test/upload` - Test upload endpoint
- **Jobs API**: `GET /api/v2/jobs` - Job status and management

### **Monitoring and Debugging**
- **Worker Logs**: `docker logs insurance_navigator-enhanced-base-worker-1`
- **API Logs**: `docker logs insurance_navigator-api-server-1`
- **Database Access**: `docker exec insurance_navigator-postgres-1 psql -U postgres -d postgres`
- **Cost Tracking**: Available through enhanced worker's cost tracker system

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issues and Limitations**

### **Current Limitations**
1. **API Authentication**: Main upload endpoint requires authentication (not configured for testing)
2. **LlamaParse Health Endpoint**: Returns 404 (expected behavior, not a real issue)
3. **Service Status**: Shows "degraded" due to LlamaParse health check, but services are functional

### **Workarounds Available**
1. **Test Endpoints**: Use `/test/upload` for testing without authentication
2. **Direct Worker Testing**: Test enhanced worker functionality directly through logs and monitoring
3. **Mock Service Fallback**: System automatically falls back to mock services if real services fail
