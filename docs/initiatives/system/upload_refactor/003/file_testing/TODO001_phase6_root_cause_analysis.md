# Root Cause Analysis: Pipeline Stoppage at Parsed Stage

**Issue**: Documents cannot progress beyond stage 3.4 (`parsed`) in the upload processing pipeline  
**Impact**: Complete end-to-end pipeline validation blocked  
**Date**: August 27, 2025  
**Analysis Scope**: Phase 6 API Integration Testing

## Problem Statement

During Phase 6 testing, no documents have successfully completed the full pipeline from upload to `embedded` stage. All processing stops at stage 3.4 (`parsed`) despite having operational API integrations and working infrastructure components.

## Current System State

### Pipeline Status
- **Small files**: 4 instances of `simulated_insurance_document.pdf`
  - 2 at stage `parsed` (stuck)
  - 2 at stage `queued` (not progressing)
- **Large files**: 2 instances of `scan_classic_hmo.pdf`  
  - 2 at stage `queued` (not progressing)
- **Completed files**: 0 (`embedded` stage)

### Worker Status
- **Enhanced Worker**: Circuit breaker activated due to repeated failures
- **Base Worker**: Available but integration issues preventing full pipeline processing

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Root Cause: Database Schema Mismatch

**Issue**: Enhanced worker expects `status` column, database uses `state` column

**Evidence**:
```
ERROR: column "status" of relation "upload_jobs" does not exist
```

**Database Schema Reality**:
```sql
\d upload_pipeline.upload_jobs
-- Shows: state column (not status)
-- Values: 'queued', 'working', 'retryable', 'done', 'deadletter'
```

**Worker Expectation**: Enhanced worker code references `status` column that doesn't exist

**Impact**: Worker cannot update job status, causing transaction failures and circuit breaker activation

### Secondary Root Cause: Missing Parsed Content Validation

**Issue**: Jobs at `parsed` stage lack required `parsed_path` validation data

**Evidence**:
```
ValueError: No parsed_path found for parsed job
```

**What Worker Expects**:
1. Document record with valid `parsed_path` field
2. Actual parsed content accessible at that path
3. Validation that parsing was successful

**Current Reality**:
- Documents may have `parsed_path` field set
- But no actual parsed content exists at those paths
- Worker cannot validate parsing completion

### Tertiary Root Cause: Circuit Breaker Pattern Activated

**Issue**: Enhanced worker circuit breaker opened due to repeated failures

**Evidence**:
```
Circuit breaker opened due to repeated failures, failure_count: 5
```

**Mechanism**: After 5 consecutive failures, circuit breaker stops all processing to prevent system degradation

**Trigger Sequence**:
1. Worker attempts to process `parsed` stage job
2. Fails due to missing `parsed_path` validation
3. Attempts to mark job as failed using non-existent `status` column
4. Database transaction fails
5. Repeat 5 times → Circuit breaker opens

## Detailed Analysis by Pipeline Stage

### Stage 3.1 → 3.2 (queued → job_validated)
- **Status**: ✅ Working for some files
- **Issue**: Some files stuck at `queued` stage
- **Probable Cause**: Worker not picking up jobs due to circuit breaker

### Stage 3.2 → 3.3 (job_validated → parsing)  
- **Status**: ✅ Working (files reach `parsing`)
- **Evidence**: Files successfully transition through this stage

### Stage 3.3 → 3.4 (parsing → parsed)
- **Status**: ✅ Working (files reach `parsed`)
- **Evidence**: Multiple files have reached `parsed` stage

### Stage 3.4 → 3.5 (parsed → parse_validated)
- **Status**: ❌ **BLOCKED** - This is where all processing stops
- **Root Cause**: `parsed_path` validation failure

### Stages 3.5 → 3.7 (parse_validated → embedding)
- **Status**: ❌ **NOT REACHED** - No files progress past 3.4

## Technical Deep Dive

### Enhanced Worker Code Analysis

**Expected Flow at `parsed` Stage**:
1. Retrieve job with `stage = 'parsed'`
2. Call `_validate_parsed_enhanced(job, correlation_id)`
3. Check for `parsed_path` in document record
4. Validate parsed content exists and is accessible
5. Progress to next stage

**Failure Point**: Step 3 - `parsed_path` validation

```python
# From worker logs:
await self._validate_parsed_enhanced(job, correlation_id)
# Raises: ValueError("No parsed_path found for parsed job")
```

### Database State Investigation

**Documents Table**:
```sql
SELECT document_id, filename, parsed_path, processing_status 
FROM upload_pipeline.documents 
WHERE filename IN ('simulated_insurance_document.pdf', 'scan_classic_hmo.pdf');
```

**Expected**: `parsed_path` should contain valid path to parsed content  
**Reality**: Some documents have `null` parsed_path, others have paths but no actual content

**Upload Jobs Table**:
```sql
SELECT job_id, stage, state, updated_at 
FROM upload_pipeline.upload_jobs 
WHERE stage = 'parsed';
```

**Expected**: Jobs should progress through stages automatically  
**Reality**: Jobs stuck at `parsed` stage with `state = 'queued'`

## Contributing Factors

### 1. Test Data Quality
- **Issue**: Using existing test documents that may not have complete parsing workflow
- **Impact**: Documents lack proper parsed content required for validation
- **Example**: Files uploaded directly to database without actual parsing process

### 2. Worker Integration Mismatch
- **Issue**: Enhanced worker (TVDb001) designed for different schema than current database
- **Impact**: Schema expectations don't align with actual database structure
- **Symptoms**: Column name mismatches, different field requirements

### 3. Mock Service Integration
- **Issue**: Mock services may not generate expected artifacts
- **Impact**: Parsing stage completes but doesn't create validation artifacts needed for next stage
- **Evidence**: Files marked as `parsed` but missing parsed content

### 4. Environment Configuration
- **Issue**: Development environment may have different requirements than worker expectations
- **Impact**: Worker configured for production-style processing but database has development test data
- **Symptoms**: Validation failures due to missing production-style artifacts

## Impact Assessment

### Immediate Impact
- **Severity**: HIGH - Complete pipeline validation blocked
- **Scope**: All test files affected
- **Business Impact**: Cannot validate production readiness

### Secondary Impact  
- **Phase 6 Completion**: Cannot claim successful API integration without end-to-end validation
- **Production Deployment**: Cannot recommend production deployment without proven pipeline
- **Technical Debt**: Schema mismatches need resolution before production

## Potential Solutions

### Solution 1: Schema Alignment (Recommended)
**Approach**: Align enhanced worker with current database schema
- Modify enhanced worker to use `state` column instead of `status`
- Update all SQL queries and field references
- Test with existing database structure

**Pros**: 
- Maintains current database schema
- Fastest path to working solution
- No data migration required

**Cons**:
- Requires worker code modifications
- May affect TVDb001 pattern compliance

### Solution 2: Database Schema Update
**Approach**: Update database to match enhanced worker expectations
- Add `status` column to `upload_jobs` table
- Migrate data from `state` to `status`
- Update constraints and indexes

**Pros**:
- Maintains TVDb001 worker patterns unchanged
- Future-compatible with enhanced worker

**Cons**:
- Requires database migration
- Risk of data inconsistency
- More complex deployment

### Solution 3: Hybrid Approach
**Approach**: Create compatibility layer
- Add `status` column as alias/view of `state` column
- Maintain both naming conventions
- Gradual migration path

**Pros**:
- Backward compatibility
- Supports both worker types
- Lower risk migration

**Cons**:
- Technical complexity
- Maintenance overhead
- Temporary solution

### Solution 4: Complete Pipeline Test with Fresh Upload
**Approach**: Upload fresh document through API to ensure proper pipeline initialization
- Use actual upload API endpoint with authentication
- Ensure document goes through proper parsing workflow
- Validate each stage has required artifacts

**Pros**:
- Tests actual production workflow
- Validates API integration properly
- Most realistic test scenario

**Cons**:
- Requires API authentication setup
- May still hit same schema issues
- More complex test setup

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Fix (Schema Alignment)
1. **Modify Enhanced Worker**: Update to use `state` column
2. **Test Basic Progression**: Verify jobs can progress beyond `parsed`
3. **Validate One Complete Pipeline**: Get one document to `embedded` stage

### Phase 2: Proper Content Validation
1. **Fix Parsed Path Validation**: Ensure parsed content exists and is accessible
2. **Mock Service Integration**: Verify mock services generate required artifacts
3. **End-to-End Test**: Complete pipeline test with both small and large files

### Phase 3: Production Readiness
1. **Real Service Testing**: Test with actual external APIs
2. **Performance Validation**: Measure processing times and success rates
3. **Production Schema**: Align with production database requirements

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Success (Phase 6 Completion)
- [ ] At least 1 document reaches `embedded` stage autonomously
- [ ] Pipeline processes both small and large files successfully  
- [ ] All stages 3.1-3.7 validated with actual transitions
- [ ] Worker operates without circuit breaker activation

### Full Success (Production Readiness)
- [ ] 100% success rate for test documents
- [ ] Processing times within acceptable limits
- [ ] Real API integration working end-to-end
- [ ] Error handling validated with recovery scenarios

## Conclusion

The root cause of pipeline stoppage is a **database schema mismatch** combined with **missing parsed content validation**. The enhanced worker expects database fields and artifacts that don't exist in the current development environment.

**Primary Blocker**: `status` vs `state` column mismatch preventing worker from updating job progress  
**Secondary Blocker**: Missing `parsed_path` validation preventing stage progression  
**Tertiary Effect**: Circuit breaker activation stopping all processing

**Immediate Action Required**: Schema alignment to enable basic pipeline progression  
**Success Metric**: Get at least one document to `embedded` stage before completing Phase 6

This analysis shows we have validated API integration components but not complete autonomous processing capability.
