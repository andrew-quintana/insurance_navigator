## Phase 3.6 Requirements

### **Primary Objective**
**VALIDATE** the automatic transition from `chunking` to `chunks_stored` stage by ensuring the worker process successfully completes chunking operations and advances jobs to the final chunking stage.

### **Success Criteria for Phase 3.6**
- [ ] Worker automatically processes jobs in `chunking` stage
- [ ] Jobs transition from `chunking` to `chunks_stored` stage
- [ ] Chunking completion logic executes correctly
- [ ] Final chunking stage is properly set
- [ ] Database updates reflect final chunking stage transitions accurately
- [ ] Error handling for chunking completion failures works correctly

### **Technical Focus Areas**

#### 1. Chunking Completion Processing
- Validate `_process_chunks()` method completion logic
- Test final chunking stage transition
- Verify chunking completion database updates
- Check chunking completion error handling

#### 2. Final Chunking Stage Logic
- Test chunking completion and finalization
- Validate final stage setting logic
- Verify chunking completion metadata
- Test error scenarios for completion failures

#### 3. Database State Management
- Monitor job stage transitions to final chunking stage
- Validate database update operations during completion
- Check for constraint violations and transaction management
- Verify final chunking stage metadata

### **Testing Procedures for Phase 3.6**

#### Step 1: Environment Verification
```bash
# Check current database state
docker exec insurance_navigator-postgres-1 psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "SELECT stage, COUNT(*) FROM upload_pipeline.upload_jobs GROUP BY stage;"

# Verify chunking stage completion
docker exec insurance_navigator-postgres-1 psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "SELECT job_id, stage, state FROM upload_pipeline.upload_jobs WHERE stage IN ('chunking', 'chunks_stored');"
```

#### Step 2: Chunking Completion Validation
```bash
# Monitor worker processing for chunking completion
docker-compose logs base-worker -f

# Verify chunking completion logic
# Test final chunking stage transitions
```

#### Step 3: Stage Transition Validation
```sql
-- Monitor job stage changes to final chunking stage
SELECT job_id, stage, updated_at, parsed_path
FROM upload_pipeline.upload_jobs 
WHERE stage IN ('chunking', 'chunks_stored')
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
```

async def _process_chunks(self, job: Dict[str, Any], correlation_id: str):
    """Generate chunks with comprehensive validation"""
    # Complete implementation with document_chunk_buffer integration
    # Ready for Phase 3.6 to test transition to chunks_stored stage
```

### **Worker Query Enhancement** ✅
```python
# Updated job query includes chunking stage
WHERE uj.stage IN (
    'job_validated', 'parsing', 'parsed', 'parse_validated', 'chunking', 'chunks_buffered',
    'embedding', 'embeddings_buffered'
)
```

### **Main Processing Logic** ✅
```python
# Enhanced main processing switch
elif status == "parse_validated":
    await self._process_chunks(job, correlation_id)  # Ready for Phase 3.5
elif status == "chunking":
    await self._complete_chunking(job, correlation_id)  # Ready for Phase 3.6
```

## Phase 3.6 Focus Areas

### **1. Chunking Completion Logic**
The chunking completion logic needs validation:

```python
async def _complete_chunking(self, job: Dict[str, Any], correlation_id: str):
    """Complete chunking stage and advance to final stage"""
    # Implementation needs Phase 3.6 testing
    # - Verify chunking completion
    # - Set final chunking stage
    # - Advance to next processing stage
```

### **2. Final Stage Management**
Phase 3.6 should focus on:
- Testing chunking completion logic
- Validating final stage transitions
- Testing error handling for completion failures
- Verifying final stage metadata

### **3. Database Integration**
Phase 3.6 validation should include:
- Stage transition to final chunking stage
- Final stage metadata storage
- Completion tracking and validation
- Transaction management during completion
