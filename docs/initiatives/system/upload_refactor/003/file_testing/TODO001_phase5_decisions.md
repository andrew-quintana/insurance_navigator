**Date**: August 26, 2025  
**Scope**: Enhanced Worker Integration and Real Service Configuration  

## 🎯 **Strategic Decisions**

### **Decision 1: Leverage Existing TVDb001 Implementation**
**Decision**: Use the existing enhanced worker and service router from TVDb001 instead of building new components from scratch.

**Rationale**:
- **Time Efficiency**: TVDb001 already implemented comprehensive development service system
- **Proven Architecture**: Service router pattern already tested and validated
- **Feature Completeness**: Includes cost management, health monitoring, and fallback mechanisms
- **Resource Optimization**: Avoids duplicate development effort

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Building new development service configuration from scratch
- Extending existing base worker with limited functionality
- Creating hybrid solution combining multiple approaches

**Outcome**: ✅ **SUCCESSFUL** - Significantly accelerated Phase 5 completion

### **Decision 2: Service Router Architecture**
**Decision**: Implement service router pattern supporting MOCK, REAL, and HYBRID modes.

**Rationale**:
- **Flexibility**: Allows dynamic switching between service implementations
- **Fallback Protection**: Automatic fallback to mock services when real services fail
- **Testing Support**: Enables testing with both mock and real services
- **Production Readiness**: Gradual migration path from development to production

**Architecture Pattern**:
```python
class ServiceRouter:
    def get_service(self, service_name: str, mode: ServiceMode):
        if mode == ServiceMode.MOCK:
            return self.services[service_name]['mock']
        elif mode == ServiceMode.REAL:
            return self.services[service_name]['real']
        else: # HYBRID
            return self._get_hybrid_service(service_name)
```

**Outcome**: ✅ **SUCCESSFUL** - All service modes operational with automatic fallback

### **Decision 3: Enhanced Worker Integration**

    async def is_available(self) -> bool
    @abstractmethod
    async def get_health(self) -> Dict[str, Any]

# Real implementation
class LlamaParseClient(LlamaParseService):
    async def is_available(self) -> bool
    async def get_health(self) -> Dict[str, Any]

# Mock implementation  
class MockLlamaParseService(LlamaParseService):
