# Phase 5 Addition Summary

## Overview

**Date**: August 26, 2025  
**Initiative**: Upload Refactor 003 File Testing  
**Objective**: Add Phase 5 for development end-to-end testing between current Phase 4 and Phase 5 (now Phase 6)

## Phase Structure Changes

### ✅ Original Phase Structure
```
Phase 4: End-to-End Pipeline Validation
Phase 5: API Integration
```

### ✅ New Phase Structure
```
Phase 4: End-to-End Pipeline Validation
Phase 5: Development End-to-End Testing (NEW)
Phase 6: API Integration (was Phase 5)
Phase 7: Documentation & Reporting (reorganized)
```

## Changes Made

### ✅ **File Renames and Updates**

1. **PHASE5_PROMPT.md → PHASE6_PROMPT.md**
   - Renamed existing Phase 5 (API Integration) to Phase 6
   - Updated all internal references from Phase 5 → Phase 6
   - Updated handoff documentation references

2. **New PHASE5_PROMPT.md Created**
   - Development End-to-End Testing phase
   - Focus on development-level service integration
   - Service router configuration for development services

3. **Phase File Renames**
   - `TODO001_phase5_*.md` → `TODO001_phase6_*.md`

### ✅ **Documentation Updates**

1. **TODO001.md** - Restructured phases to include new Phase 5
2. **PHASE4_PROMPT.md** - Updated next phase reference
3. **BUFFER_TABLE_REMOVAL_SUMMARY.md** - Updated phase references

## New Phase 5 Focus

**Development End-to-End Testing** bridges the gap between mock services (Phase 4) and production APIs (Phase 6):

- Configure development-level external services
- Update service router for development mode
- Test realistic service constraints and error handling
- Validate performance under development service limits

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 4**: Continue with end-to-end pipeline validation
2. **Phase 5**: Implement development service integration  
3. **Phase 6**: Proceed with production API integration
