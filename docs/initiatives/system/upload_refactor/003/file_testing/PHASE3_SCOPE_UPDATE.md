- [ ] Data integrity maintained throughout pipeline
- [ ] Processing state progression verified
- [ ] Ready for Phase 4 integration testing

### Phase 4 Success
- [ ] Complete end-to-end pipeline integration validated
- [ ] All failure scenarios handled gracefully

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase 3.2**: Worker automation and automatic job processing
2. **Execute Phases 3.3-3.9**: Systematic stage transition validation
3. **Begin Phase 4**: End-to-end workflow validation and integration testing
4. **Validate Production Readiness**: Confirm system ready for deployment

## Impact on Overall Testing

This scope change ensures that:
- **File storage testing** is complete (Phase 2.1)
- **Database processing testing** is systematic and comprehensive (Phase 3 sub-phases)
- **End-to-end integration testing** covers complete workflow (Phase 4)
- **Performance characteristics** are understood and documented
- **Production readiness** is validated before deployment

The updated Phase 3 and Phase 4 provide a much more focused and valuable validation of the complete processing pipeline, which is essential for understanding how the system will perform under real-world conditions and ensuring production readiness.

## Database Configuration Note
**IMPORTANT**: All testing uses the **postgres database** (not accessa_dev). Ensure all database connections and queries reference the correct database name.
