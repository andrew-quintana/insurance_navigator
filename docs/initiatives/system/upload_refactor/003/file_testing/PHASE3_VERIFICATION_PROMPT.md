# PHASE 3: Database Flow Verification and Processing Outcomes

## Objective
Verify the complete database flow from upload initiation through all processing stages, ensuring every database table captures and processes the upload data correctly with proper relationships and state transitions.

## Context
Phase 2.1 successfully validated the upload endpoint and file storage. Now Phase 3 focuses on the **database processing pipeline** - how each database table processes the upload data, maintains relationships, and tracks the complete lifecycle of uploaded documents.

## Prerequisites
- ✅ Phase 2.1 completed: Upload endpoint working, files stored in Supabase
- ✅ JWT authentication working correctly
- ✅ Environment configuration validated (development mode)
- ✅ Test document successfully uploaded and stored

## Core Focus: Database Processing Flow

### 1. Database Schema Flow Verification
Track the complete data flow through every database table:

#### Primary Flow Path
```
Upload Request → Documents Table → Upload Jobs Table → Events Table → Processing State
```

#### Secondary Flow Paths
```
User Authentication → User Sessions → Access Logs
File Storage → Storage Metadata → Bucket References
Job Processing → Worker Assignments → Status Updates
```

### 2. Expected Processing State Flow

#### Full State Progression
```
queued → job_validated → parsing → parsed → parse_validated → chunking → chunks_buffered → embedding → embedded
```

#### Job Status Definitions

- **queued**: Initial state when job is first created. Document has been uploaded and a job has been enqueued for processing.
- **job_validated**: Confirmed via hash not to be a dupe upload, proceeds to this state to confirm it needs processing
- **parsing**: Document is actively being processed by the parser (e.g., LlamaParse) to extract text and structure.
- **parsed**: Parser has completed processing and returned results via webhook, but results haven't been validated yet.
- **parse_validated**: Parsed content has been validated (format, completeness, uniqueness in blob storage) and is ready for chunking.
- **chunking**: System is actively dividing the parsed document into semantic chunks for embedding and deduped via hashing.
- **chunks_buffered**: All chunks have been created and stored in the appropriate table but not yet committed to the main chunks table.
- **embedding**: System is actively generating vector embeddings for the document chunks in the buffer table. (As each row is embedded written to the `document_chunks` table (with hashing deduping) it is removed from the buffer table.
- **embedded**: All embeddings have been successfully written to the appropriate chunks and the chunks have been moved from the buffer to the `document_chunks` table. The table is ready for rag operations.

### 3. Table-by-Table Processing Verification

#### A. Documents Table (`upload_pipeline.documents`)
**Purpose**: Master record of uploaded documents
**Verification Tasks**:
- [ ] Document record created with correct metadata
- [ ] All required fields populated (document_id, user_id, filename, mime, bytes_len, file_sha256, raw_path)
- [ ] Timestamps accurate (created_at, updated_at)
- [ ] File path follows expected naming convention
- [ ] SHA256 hash matches actual file content
- [ ] File size matches actual file size

**Expected Processing**:
- Record created immediately upon upload acceptance
- Status: "uploaded" or "pending_processing"
- Raw path points to actual Supabase storage location

#### B. Upload Jobs Table (`upload_pipeline.upload_jobs`)
**Purpose**: Processing queue and job lifecycle management
**Verification Tasks**:

- [ ] Vector embeddings properly stored
- [ ] Chunks linked to original document

#### G. Chunk Buffer Table (if applicable)
**Purpose**: Temporary storage during chunking and embedding
**Verification Tasks**:
- [ ] Chunks stored in buffer during processing
- [ ] Buffer cleared as chunks are embedded
- [ ] No orphaned chunks left in buffer
- [ ] Proper cleanup after embedding complete

### 4. Cross-Table Relationship Verification

#### Primary Relationships
- [ ] `documents.document_id` ↔ `upload_jobs.document_id`
- [ ] `upload_jobs.job_id` ↔ `events.job_id`
- [ ] `documents.user_id` ↔ `upload_jobs.user_id`
