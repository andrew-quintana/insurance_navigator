# TEST_METHOD001 â€” Upload Refactor 003 File Testing Methodology

## Purpose
Validate the end-to-end functionality of the upload refactor 003 system by testing document upload, processing, storage, and database record creation using representative insurance documents.

## Scope

### Inclusions
- PDF document upload functionality
- File storage verification in Supabase buckets
- Database record creation and integrity
- File path accuracy and accessibility
- Upload service endpoint validation
- Authentication and authorization flows
- Error handling and edge cases

### Exclusions
- Performance benchmarking (separate test suite)
- Security penetration testing (separate security audit)
- Mobile client testing (web interface only)
- Bulk upload scenarios (single file focus)

## Verification Goals
1. **Functional Verification**: Confirm upload pipeline processes documents correctly
2. **Data Integrity**: Verify database records match uploaded file metadata
3. **Storage Validation**: Ensure files are stored in correct buckets with proper paths
4. **Accessibility**: Confirm uploaded files can be retrieved and accessed
5. **Traceability**: Validate complete audit trail from upload to storage

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Documents upload without errors
- [ ] Database records created with correct metadata
- [ ] Files stored in designated Supabase buckets
- [ ] File paths are accessible and valid
- [ ] Upload timestamps are accurate
- [ ] File size and type validation works correctly
- [ ] Visual inspection links are functional

## Environment
- **System**: Upload Refactor 003 implementation
- **Database**: Supabase production/staging instance
- **Storage**: Supabase bucket storage
- **Client**: Web interface
- **Authentication**: Standard user authentication flow

## Setup Requirements
1. Supabase connection verified
2. Upload service endpoints accessible
3. Test documents available:
   - `examples/simulated_insurance_document.pdf` (1.7KB)
   - `examples/scan_classic_hmo_parsed.pdf` (2.4MB)
4. Database access for verification queries
5. Bucket access for storage verification

## Test Protocol

### Phase 1: Pre-Test Validation
1. Verify upload service is running
2. Confirm database connectivity
3. Validate bucket permissions
4. Document baseline state

### Phase 2: Upload Execution
1. Upload `simulated_insurance_document.pdf`
2. Capture upload response and metadata
3. Upload `scan_classic_hmo_parsed.pdf`
4. Capture upload response and metadata

### Phase 3: Verification
1. Query database for new records
2. Verify file metadata accuracy
3. Confirm bucket storage location
4. Test file accessibility via generated links
5. Validate file integrity (size, type, checksum)

### Phase 4: Documentation
1. Record all test results
2. Generate visual inspection links
3. Document any anomalies or issues
4. Create verification report

## Traceability Matrix

| Test ID | Requirement | Test Case | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| TC001 | File Upload | Upload PDF document | HTTP 200, upload ID returned | TBD | Pending |
| TC002 | Database Record | Verify DB entry creation | Record exists with correct metadata | TBD | Pending |
| TC003 | Bucket Storage | Confirm file in bucket | File accessible in designated bucket | TBD | Pending |
| TC004 | File Path | Validate storage path | Path follows expected naming convention | TBD | Pending |
| TC005 | File Integrity | Verify file contents | Uploaded file matches original | TBD | Pending |
| TC006 | Access Links | Test download links | Links provide valid file access | TBD | Pending |

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk
- **Data Loss**: Files uploaded but not properly stored
  - *Mitigation*: Immediate verification after each upload
- **Database Corruption**: Invalid records created
  - *Mitigation*: Transaction rollback capabilities verified

### Medium Risk
- **Permission Issues**: Access denied to buckets/database
  - *Mitigation*: Pre-test permission validation
- **Network Failures**: Upload interruption
  - *Mitigation*: Retry mechanisms and error logging

### Low Risk
- **File Format Issues**: Unsupported PDF variants
  - *Mitigation*: Use known-good test documents

## Reporting
- **Success Metrics**: Upload completion rate, data integrity score
- **Failure Tracking**: Error codes, failure points, recovery actions
- **Performance Notes**: Upload duration, processing time
- **Visual Evidence**: Screenshots of database records, bucket contents
- **Inspection Links**: Direct URLs for manual verification

## Test Execution Date
