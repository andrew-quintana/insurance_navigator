# Phase 3.5 Execution Prompt: parse_validated â†’ chunking Transition Validation

## Context
You are implementing Phase 3.5 of the upload refactor 003 file testing initiative. This phase focuses on validating the automatic transition from `parse_validated` to `chunking` stage, building upon the successful parse validation implementation from Phase 3.4.

## Documentation References
Please review these documents before starting implementation:
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/TODO001.md` - Phase 3.5 requirements and tasks
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/TEST_METHOD001.md` - Testing methodology and procedures
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/TODO001_phase3.4_handoff.md` - **REQUIRED**: Phase 3.4 handoff notes and requirements
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/PHASE3_SCOPE_UPDATE.md` - Phase 3 scope and objectives

## Primary Objective
**VALIDATE** the automatic transition from `parse_validated` to `chunking` stage by ensuring the worker process successfully initiates chunking operations and advances jobs to the next stage.

## Expected Outputs
Document your work in these files:
- `TODO001_phase3.5_notes.md` - Phase 3.5 implementation details and validation results
- `TODO001_phase3.5_decisions.md` - Technical decisions and chunking initiation approaches
- `TODO001_phase3.5_handoff.md` - **REQUIRED**: Comprehensive handoff notes for Phase 3.6 transition
- `TODO001_phase3.5_testing_summary.md` - Phase 3.5 testing results and status

## Implementation Approach
1. **Review Phase 3.4 Handoff**: **REQUIRED**: Read and understand all Phase 3.4 handoff requirements
2. **Verify Current System State**: Confirm parse validation completion and database state from Phase 3.4
3. **Test Chunking Initiation Processing**: Validate worker handles `parse_validated` stage jobs automatically
4. **Validate Chunking Logic**: Test chunking initiation and preparation logic
5. **Confirm Stage Transitions**: Verify jobs advance from `parse_validated` to `chunking` stage
6. **Document Results**: Record all findings and prepare for Phase 3.6
7. **Create Handoff Notes**: **REQUIRED**: Document complete handoff requirements for next phase

- **Environment Configuration**: âœ… Docker Compose stack fully operational

## Technical Focus Areas

### 1. Chunking Initiation Processing
- Validate `_process_parse_validated()` method implementation
- Test chunking initiation logic execution
- Verify stage transition database updates
- Check for any missing dependencies or imports

### 2. Chunking Logic
- Test chunking preparation and setup
- Validate chunking configuration and parameters
- Verify chunking strategy selection
- Test error handling for chunking failures

### 3. Database State Management
- Monitor job stage transitions in real-time
- Validate database update operations during chunking initiation
- Check for any constraint violations
- Verify transaction management

## Testing Procedures

### Step 1: Phase 3.4 Handoff Review
```bash
# REQUIRED: Review Phase 3.4 handoff notes
cat docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/TODO001_phase3.4_handoff.md

# Verify current system state matches handoff expectations
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs base-worker --tail=20
```

### Step 2: Environment Verification
```bash
# Check worker service status
docker-compose ps base-worker

# Check worker logs for chunking activity
docker-compose logs base-worker --tail=50

# Verify parse_validated stage jobs exist
docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f name=postgres) psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "SELECT stage, COUNT(*) FROM upload_pipeline.upload_jobs GROUP BY stage;"
```

### Step 3: Chunking Initiation Stage Validation
```bash
# Monitor worker processing in real-time
docker-compose logs base-worker -f

# Check database for stage transitions
# Monitor for automatic chunking initiation processing
```

### Step 4: Chunking Logic Testing
```bash
# Test chunking initiation logic
# Verify chunking preparation and setup
# Test error handling for chunking failures
```

### Step 5: Stage Transition Validation
```sql
-- Monitor job stage changes
SELECT job_id, stage, updated_at
FROM upload_pipeline.upload_jobs 
WHERE stage IN ('parse_validated', 'chunking')
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Success Scenario
- Worker automatically processes `parse_validated` stage jobs
- Jobs transition from `parse_validated` to `chunking` stage
- Chunking initiation logic working correctly
