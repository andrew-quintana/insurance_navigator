# Phase 6 Execution Prompt: API Integration

## Context
You are implementing Phase 6 of the upload refactor 003 file testing initiative. This phase focuses on API integration, building upon the successful development end-to-end testing from Phase 5.

## Documentation References
Please review these documents before starting implementation:
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/TODO001.md` - Phase 6 requirements and tasks
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/TEST_METHOD001.md` - Testing methodology and procedures
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/TODO001_phase5_handoff.md` - **REQUIRED**: Phase 5 handoff notes and requirements
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/PHASE3_SCOPE_UPDATE.md` - Phase 3 scope and objectives

### TVDb001 Reference Methodologies and Workflows
**Important**: Leverage proven test methods and workflows from TVDb001 phases 1-5:
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TVDb001/TODOTVDb001_phase2.5_handoff.md` - Real API integration testing methodologies with 95.8% success rate
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TVDb001/TODOTVDb001_phase3_handoff.md` - LlamaParse webhook integration patterns and security implementation
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TVDb001/TODOTVDb001_phase4_handoff.md` - OpenAI real API integration with comprehensive testing framework
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TVDb001/TODOTVDb001_phase5_handoff.md` - EnhancedBaseWorker production deployment and testing strategies

#### Key TVDb001 Testing Patterns to Adopt:
1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: 24+ test scenarios covering service integration, cost tracking, and error handling
2. **Real Service Validation**: Validated real API connectivity with fallback mechanisms
3. **Security Implementation**: HMAC signature verification and secure error handling patterns
4. **Cost Management**: Real-time cost tracking with budget enforcement (95.8% success validation)
5. **Service Router Integration**: MOCK/REAL/HYBRID mode switching with health monitoring
6. **Error Handling Patterns**: Circuit breakers, retry logic, and graceful degradation

## Primary Objective
**INTEGRATE** external APIs into the upload processing pipeline by implementing API connections, validating data flow integration, and ensuring seamless operation with external services.

### Simple Testing Approach
**Important**: The testing for Phase 6 should be straightforward and follow the proven Phase 3 pipeline validation approach. Testing should focus on validating each processing stage transition (3.1 through 3.7) with both small and large files:

#### Pipeline Stage Validation (Following Phase 3 Methodology)
1. **Stage 3.1**: queued → job_validated transition
2. **Stage 3.2**: job_validated → parsing transition  
3. **Stage 3.3**: parsing → parsed transition
4. **Stage 3.4**: parsed → parse_validated transition
5. **Stage 3.5**: parse_validated → chunking transition
6. **Stage 3.6**: chunking → chunks_buffered transition  
7. **Stage 3.7**: chunks_buffered → embedding transition

#### Test File Strategy
- **Small File**: `examples/simulated_insurance_document.pdf` (1.7KB) - For initial validation and debugging
- **Large File**: `examples/scan_classic_hmo.pdf` (2.4MB) - For comprehensive validation and performance testing

Each stage should be validated with both files to ensure the API integrations work correctly across different document sizes and processing loads.

## Expected Outputs
Document your work in these files:
- `TODO001_phase6_notes.md` - Phase 6 implementation details and API integration results
- `TODO001_phase6_decisions.md` - Technical decisions and API integration approaches
- `TODO001_phase6_handoff.md` - **REQUIRED**: Comprehensive handoff notes for project completion
- `TODO001_phase6_testing_summary.md` - Phase 6 testing results and API integration validation

## Test Files for API Integration
**Primary Test Files**:
- `examples/simulated_insurance_document.pdf` - **Small test file** for initial issue detection and debugging
- `examples/scan_classic_hmo.pdf` - **Large test file** for comprehensive testing and performance validation

**Testing Strategy**: Start with the simulated document to iron out API integration issues, then validate with the larger scan_classic_hmo.pdf for full-scale testing.

2. **Apply TVDb001 Methodologies**: **REQUIRED**: Review and adapt proven testing methodologies from TVDb001 phases 1-5

4. **API Service Assessment**: Identify and document all required external API integrations using TVDb001 assessment patterns
5. **API Implementation**: Implement API connections and data flow integration using TVDb001 integration patterns and specified test files
6. **Integration Testing**: Test API integrations using TVDb001's comprehensive testing framework (24+ scenarios) and validate data flow with both small and large test files
7. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive API error handling and resilience using TVDb001's proven patterns (circuit breakers, retry logic, graceful degradation)
