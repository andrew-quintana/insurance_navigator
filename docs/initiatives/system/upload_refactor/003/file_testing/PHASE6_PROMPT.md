## Testing Procedures

### Step 1: Phase 5 Handoff Review
```bash
# REQUIRED: Review Phase 5 handoff notes
cat docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/TODO001_phase5_handoff.md

# Verify current system state matches handoff expectations
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs base-worker --tail=20
```

### Step 2: Production Readiness Testing
```bash
# Conduct production readiness testing
python scripts/test-production-readiness.py

# Test failover and recovery procedures
python scripts/test-failover-recovery.py

# Validate backup and restore procedures
python scripts/test-backup-restore.py
```

### Step 3: Security Validation
```bash
# Validate authentication and authorization
python scripts/validate-security-measures.py

# Test data encryption and security
python scripts/test-data-encryption.py

# Validate compliance requirements
python scripts/validate-compliance.py
```

### Step 4: Operational Procedure Verification
```bash
# Test operational procedures
python scripts/test-operational-procedures.py

# Validate monitoring and alerting
python scripts/validate-monitoring-alerting.py

# Test incident response procedures
python scripts/test-incident-response.py
```

### Step 5: Deployment Preparation
```bash
# Prepare deployment artifacts
python scripts/prepare-deployment-artifacts.py

# Validate deployment procedures
python scripts/validate-deployment-procedures.py

# Test environment provisioning
python scripts/test-environment-provisioning.py
```

### Step 6: Production Readiness Validation
```sql
-- Monitor system health and readiness
SELECT 
    service_name,
    status,
    last_health_check,
    error_count
FROM system_health_status
WHERE service_name IN ('api-server', 'base-worker', 'postgres');

-- Check security and compliance status
SELECT 
    check_name,
    status,
    last_check,
    details
FROM security_compliance_checks
ORDER BY last_check DESC;
