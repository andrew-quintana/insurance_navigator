# Phase 6 Execution Prompt: Post-Test Activities

## Context
You are implementing Phase 6 of the upload refactor 003 file testing initiative. This phase focuses on completing post-test activities, including cleanup, system documentation updates, improvement recommendations, and final project closure.

## Documentation References
Please review these documents before starting implementation:
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/TODO001.md` - Phase 6 requirements and tasks
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/TEST_METHOD001.md` - Testing methodology and procedures
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/file_testing/PHASE5_PROMPT.md` - Phase 5 completion status and handoff
- All previous phase completion documents for comprehensive context

## Primary Objective
**COMPLETE** all post-test activities, including test data cleanup, system documentation updates, improvement recommendations, and final project closure to ensure the testing initiative is properly concluded.

## Expected Outputs
Document your work in these files:
- `TODO001_phase6_notes.md` - Phase 6 implementation details and closure results
- `TODO001_phase6_decisions.md` - Closure decisions and final recommendations
- `TODO001_phase6_handoff.md` - Final project closure and handoff
- `TODO001_phase6_testing_summary.md` - Phase 6 closure summary and final status

## Implementation Approach
1. **Clean Up Test Data**: Remove test data if required and appropriate
2. **Update System Documentation**: Update system documentation based on findings
3. **Recommend Improvements**: Provide recommendations for future improvements
4. **Schedule Follow-up Testing**: Plan any required follow-up testing activities
5. **Mark Initiative Complete**: Finalize project closure and handoff

# Validate system state after cleanup
python scripts/validate-post-cleanup-state.py

# Document cleanup procedures and results
python scripts/document-cleanup-results.py
```

### Step 3: Documentation Updates
```bash
# Update system documentation
python scripts/update-system-documentation.py

python scripts/document-issues-workarounds.py

# Update operational procedures
python scripts/update-operational-procedures.py
```

### Step 4: Improvement Recommendations
```bash
# Analyze testing results for improvements
python scripts/analyze-improvement-opportunities.py

python scripts/prioritize-recommendations.py
```

### Step 5: Follow-up Testing Planning
```bash
# Assess need for follow-up testing
python scripts/assess-followup-testing-needs.py

# Schedule follow-up testing if required
