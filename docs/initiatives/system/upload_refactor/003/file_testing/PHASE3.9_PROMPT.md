- Validate data flow between all stages
- Test pipeline resilience and error handling

### 2. End-to-End Workflow Testing
- Test complete document lifecycle from upload to completion
- Validate all processing stages execute in correct order
- Test pipeline performance and timing
- Verify complete data integrity throughout pipeline

### 3. Concurrent Processing Validation
- Test multiple documents processing simultaneously

## Testing Procedures

### Step 1: All Stages Verification
```bash
# Verify all 9 stages are operational
python scripts/verify-all-stages.py

# Check stage transition readiness
python scripts/check-stage-readiness.py

# Validate stage dependencies and prerequisites
python scripts/validate-stage-dependencies.py
```

### Step 2: Complete Workflow Testing
```bash
# Test complete document processing workflow
python scripts/test-complete-workflow.py

# Monitor all processing stages in real-time
docker-compose logs -f base-worker api-server

# Validate stage transition timing and coordination
python scripts/validate-stage-coordination.py
```

### Step 3: Integration Testing
```bash
# Test stage integration and data flow
python scripts/test-stage-integration.py

# Validate data integrity between stages
python scripts/validate-data-integrity.py

# Test pipeline resilience and error handling
python scripts/test-pipeline-resilience.py
```

### Step 4: Concurrent Processing Testing
```bash
# Test concurrent document processing
python scripts/test-concurrent-processing.py --concurrent=3

# Monitor system performance under load
python scripts/monitor-system-performance.py

# Test resource management and capacity
python scripts/test-resource-management.py
```

### Step 5: Traceability Validation
```bash
# Verify correlation ID tracking
python scripts/verify-correlation-tracking.py

# Validate complete audit trail
python scripts/validate-audit-trail.py

# Test error tracking and logging
python scripts/test-error-tracking.py
```

### Step 6: Database State Validation
```sql
-- Check complete pipeline state
SELECT stage, COUNT(*) as job_count,
       MIN(created_at) as earliest_job,
       MAX(updated_at) as latest_update
FROM upload_pipeline.upload_jobs 
GROUP BY stage 
ORDER BY stage;

-- Verify complete data flow
SELECT d.document_id, d.filename, uj.stage, uj.updated_at,
       dc.chunk_count, dvb.embedding_count
FROM upload_pipeline.documents d
JOIN upload_pipeline.upload_jobs uj ON d.document_id = uj.document_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT document_id, COUNT(*) as chunk_count
    FROM upload_pipeline.document_chunks
    GROUP BY document_id
) dc ON d.document_id = dc.document_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT document_id, COUNT(*) as embedding_count
    FROM upload_pipeline.document_vector_buffer
    GROUP BY document_id
) dvb ON d.document_id = dvb.document_id
ORDER BY uj.updated_at DESC;
```
