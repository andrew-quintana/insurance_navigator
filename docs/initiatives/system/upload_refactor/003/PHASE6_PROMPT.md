# Phase 6 Execution Prompt: Application Deployment and Verification

## Context
You are implementing Phase 6 of the 003 Worker Refactor iteration. This phase implements application deployment with comprehensive validation against local environment baseline, ensuring deployed application behavior matches local functionality to prevent the processing failures experienced in 002.

## Documentation References
Please review these documents before starting implementation:
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/CONTEXT003.md` - Application deployment strategy and verification framework
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TODO003.md` - Detailed implementation checklist (Phase 6 section)
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/RFC003.md` - Technical design for application deployment and verification
- `@TODO003_phase5_notes.md` - Phase 5 infrastructure deployment details and validation results
- `@TODO003_phase5_decisions.md` - Infrastructure configuration decisions and trade-offs
- `@TODO003_phase5_handoff.md` - Application deployment requirements from Phase 5
- All previous phase outputs for complete deployment context
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/002/POSTMORTEM002.md` - Application deployment failures to prevent

## Primary Objective
**IMPLEMENT** application deployment with comprehensive verification against local environment baseline. All implementation requirements, technical specifications, and detailed checklists are defined in the referenced documents.

## Expected Outputs
Document your work in these files:
- `@TODO003_phase6_notes.md` - Application deployment details and verification results
- `@TODO003_phase6_decisions.md` - Deployment configuration decisions and trade-offs
- `@TODO003_phase6_handoff.md` - Production operation requirements for Phase 7
- `@TODO003_phase6_testing_summary.md` - Production validation results and performance comparison

## Implementation Approach
1. **Read all documentation thoroughly** - Review CONTEXT003.md application deployment, RFC003.md, TODO003.md Phase 6, POSTMORTEM002.md, and all previous phase outputs
2. **Follow the detailed checklist** - Use TODO003.md Phase 6 section as your step-by-step implementation guide
3. **Reference application architecture** - Use Phase 3 BaseWorker implementation and Phase 5 infrastructure
4. **Validate against baseline** - Ensure deployed application behavior matches local environment exactly

Start by reading all referenced documentation and previous phase outputs, then implement application deployment following the detailed Phase 6 checklist and comprehensive verification requirements.
