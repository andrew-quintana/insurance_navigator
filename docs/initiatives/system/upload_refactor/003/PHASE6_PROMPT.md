# Phase 6 Execution Prompt: Local Environment and Testing Infrastructure

## Context
You are implementing Phase 6 of the 003 Worker Refactor iteration. This phase focuses on completing the local development environment and implementing comprehensive testing infrastructure, establishing a solid foundation for production deployment in Phase 7.

## Documentation References
Please review these documents before starting implementation:
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/CONTEXT003.md` - Application deployment strategy and verification framework
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TODO003.md` - Detailed implementation checklist (Phase 6 section)
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/RFC003.md` - Technical design for application deployment and verification
- `TODO003_phase5_notes.md` - Phase 5 infrastructure deployment details and validation results
- `TODO003_phase5_decisions.md` - Infrastructure configuration decisions and trade-offs
- `TODO003_phase5_handoff.md` - Application deployment requirements from Phase 5
- All previous phase outputs for complete deployment context
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/002/POSTMORTEM002.md` - Application deployment failures to prevent

## Primary Objective
**COMPLETE** the local development environment and implement comprehensive testing infrastructure to prepare for production deployment in Phase 7. This phase focuses on local validation, testing frameworks, and deployment preparation rather than actual production deployment.

## Expected Outputs
Document your work in these files:
- `TODO003_phase6_notes.md` - Local environment completion and testing infrastructure details
- `TODO003_phase6_decisions.md` - Testing infrastructure decisions and trade-offs
- `TODO003_phase6_handoff.md` - Production deployment requirements for Phase 7
- `TODO003_phase6_testing_summary.md` - Testing infrastructure validation results

## Implementation Approach
1. **Complete local environment setup** - Ensure all local services are fully operational and validated
2. **Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure** - Create frontend simulation testing and API validation frameworks
3. **Prepare for production deployment** - Document requirements and prerequisites for Phase 7
4. **Validate local baseline** - Ensure local environment serves as reliable baseline for production deployment

Start by completing the local environment setup and testing infrastructure, then document all requirements for Phase 7 production deployment.
