- **User Trust**: Comprehensive security validation builds user confidence
- **Production Readiness**: Security issues are critical for production deployment
- **Future-Proofing**: Comprehensive testing framework for ongoing security validation

**Implementation**: Implemented security tests covering:
- Authentication controls (valid/invalid credentials, missing auth)
- Authorization controls (user permissions, cross-user access)
- Data isolation (database, storage, processing isolation)
- Input validation (SQL injection, XSS, path traversal prevention)
- Encryption and privacy controls

### 7. Test Automation Level: Manual vs. Fully Automated

**Decision**: Implement fully automated testing with comprehensive automation script.

**Options Considered**:
- **Manual Execution**: Run tests manually with step-by-step procedures
- **Semi-Automated**: Automate some aspects but require manual intervention
- **Fully Automated**: Complete automation with single command execution
