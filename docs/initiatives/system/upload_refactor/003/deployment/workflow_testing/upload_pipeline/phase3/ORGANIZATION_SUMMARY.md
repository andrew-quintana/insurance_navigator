## Benefits of Organization

1. **Clear Separation**: Each type of file has its own directory
2. **Easy Navigation**: Logical grouping makes finding files simple
3. **Maintainability**: Future updates can be easily tracked
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README explains the structure
5. **Reusability**: Scripts and tests can be easily reused

## Files Cleaned Up

- Removed empty `tests/playwright/` directory
- Organized all Phase 3 related files in one location
- Created comprehensive documentation for future reference

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 4**: Begin next development phase with clean organization
2. **Documentation**: Update any references to old file locations
3. **Maintenance**: Keep the organization structure as new files are added
