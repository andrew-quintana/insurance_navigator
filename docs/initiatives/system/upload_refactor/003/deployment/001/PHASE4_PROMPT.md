# Phase 4 Prompt: Production Readiness & Monitoring

## Context for Claude Code Agent

**IMPORTANT**: You are implementing Phase 4 of cloud deployment testing - the final phase before production deployment. Phases 1 (environment setup), 2 (integration & performance), and 3 (security & accessibility) must be completed successfully before starting this phase. This phase establishes comprehensive monitoring, validates operational procedures, and prepares for production deployment.

## Autonomous Testing Framework to Implement

Based on RFC001.md interface contracts:

```python
class ProductionReadinessValidator:
    async def validate_monitoring_setup(self) -> MonitoringResult
    async def test_alerting_systems(self) -> AlertingResult
    async def validate_backup_procedures(self) -> BackupResult
    async def test_scaling_functionality(self) -> ScalingResult
    async def validate_cicd_integration(self) -> CICDResult
    async def test_deployment_procedures(self) -> DeploymentResult
    async def validate_performance_baselines(self) -> BaselineResult

class ProductionMonitoringSetup:
    async def configure_vercel_monitoring(self) -> VercelMonitoringResult
    async def configure_render_monitoring(self) -> RenderMonitoringResult
