## üö® **Issue #1: Worker Service Environment Variable Configuration**

### **Problem**
Worker service was failing with the error:
```
ValueError: SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_KEY environment variables must be set
```

### **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Environment Variable Naming Mismatch**: 
   - Worker configuration expected: `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - Production environment had: `SUPABASE_KEY`, `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

2. **Service Name Mismatch**:
   - Render dashboard service name: `insurance_navigator`
   - render.yaml expected: `insurance-navigator-worker`

3. **Configuration Not Applied**:
   - Environment variables configured in dashboard but not applied to service
   - Service redeployment required to pick up new variables

### **Resolution Steps**
1. **Fixed Environment Variable Names**:
   ```bash
   # Changed from:
   SUPABASE_KEY=***REMOVED***...
   SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=***REMOVED***...
   
   # To:
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=***REMOVED***...
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=***REMOVED***...
   ```

2. **Renamed Service in Render Dashboard**:
   - Changed service name from `insurance_navigator` to `insurance-navigator-worker`
   - Ensured consistency with render.yaml configuration

3. **Triggered Service Redeployment**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://api.render.com/v1/services/srv-d2h5mr8dl3ps73fvvlog/deploys" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $RENDER_CLI_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"clearCache": "clear"}'
   ```

### **Result**
‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Worker service now starts successfully with all environment variables properly configured.

## üö® **Issue #2: API Service Missing Document Encryption Key**

### **Problem**
API service was failing with the error:
```
ValueError: Document encryption key not configured
```

### **Root Cause Analysis**
- The `DOCUMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable was defined in development but missing from production
- API service requires this key for document encryption functionality

### **Resolution Steps**
1. **Identified Missing Variable**:
   ```bash
   # Found in .env.development:
   DOCUMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=iSUAmk2NHMNW5bsn8F0UnPSCk9L+IxZhu/v/UyDwFcc=
   
   # Missing from .env.production
   ```

2. **Added to Production Environment**:
   ```bash
   echo "DOCUMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=iSUAmk2NHMNW5bsn8F0UnPSCk9L+IxZhu/v/UyDwFcc=" >> .env.production
   ```

3. **Configured in Render Dashboard**:
   - Added `DOCUMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable to API service
   - Triggered service redeployment

### **Result**
‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: API service now starts successfully with document encryption functionality.

## üö® **Issue #3: Worker Service Importing Main API Database Configuration**

### **Problem**
Worker service was importing from `/app/config/database.py` (main API configuration) instead of using its own configuration, causing environment variable conflicts.

### **Root Cause Analysis**
- Worker's Dockerfile was copying the entire `backend/workers/` directory
- The worker was somehow importing the main API's database configuration
- This caused conflicts between worker and API environment variable expectations

### **Resolution Steps**
1. **Updated Worker Dockerfile**:
   ```dockerfile
   # Added line to remove conflicting config files
   RUN rm -rf ./config/ 2>/dev/null || true
   ```

2. **Optimized Docker Build**:
   - Implemented multi-stage build for faster deployment
   - Separated build and runtime dependencies
   - Optimized layer caching

3. **Redeployed Worker Service**:
   - Triggered new deployment with fixed Dockerfile
   - Verified worker uses its own configuration

### **Result**
‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Worker service now uses its own configuration and starts successfully.

## üö® **Issue #4: Docker Build Performance**

### **Problem**
Docker builds were taking 20-30 minutes, significantly slowing down deployment cycles.

### **Root Cause Analysis**
- Single-stage Docker builds
- No dependency caching optimization
- Redundant package installations
- Large final image sizes

### **Resolution Steps**
1. **Implemented Multi-stage Builds**:
   ```dockerfile
   # Builder stage
   FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc g++
   COPY requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /tmp/requirements.txt
   
   # Final stage
   FROM python:3.11-slim
   COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages
   COPY --from=builder /usr/local/bin /usr/local/bin
   ```

2. **Optimized Dependencies**:
   - Separated build and runtime dependencies
   - Implemented proper layer caching
   - Reduced final image size

3. **Health Check Optimization**:
   ```dockerfile
   HEALTHCHECK --interval=15s --timeout=5s --start-period=10s --retries=2 \
     CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1
   ```

### **Result**
‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Build times significantly reduced with optimized multi-stage builds.

## üö® **Issue #5: Incorrect API Endpoint Testing**

### **Problem**
Cloud integration tests were failing because they were testing the wrong upload endpoint (`/upload` instead of `/upload-document-backend`).

### **Root Cause Analysis**
- Test framework was using incorrect endpoint URL
- API service uses `/upload-document-backend` endpoint
- Tests were expecting 405 Method Not Allowed but getting 404 Not Found

### **Resolution Steps**
1. **Identified Correct Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   grep -r "upload" main.py
   # Found: @app.post("/upload-document-backend")
   ```

2. **Updated Test Framework**:
   ```python
   # Changed from:
   async with self.session.post(f"{self.config['api_url']}/upload", data=data, timeout=60) as response:
   
   # To:
   async with self.session.post(f"{self.config['api_url']}/upload-document-backend", data=data, timeout=60) as response:
   ```

3. **Updated Test Expectations**:
   - Changed expected response from 405 to 401 (Unauthorized)
   - Updated test validation logic

### **Result**
‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Tests now correctly validate the upload endpoint functionality.

## üö® **Issue #6: Frontend Build Failures**

### **Problem**
Frontend deployment was failing with TypeScript errors and dependency issues.

### **Root Cause Analysis**
- Missing TypeScript dependencies
- Legacy peer dependency conflicts
- Performance metrics interface issues

### **Resolution Steps**
1. **Fixed TypeScript Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install @radix-ui/react-label --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. **Updated Vercel Configuration**:
   ```json
   {
     "installCommand": "npm install --legacy-peer-deps"
   }
   ```

3. **Fixed Performance Metrics**:
   ```typescript
   // Added missing memoryUsed property
   memoryUsed: 0
   
   // Fixed type casting for performance entries
   const firstEntry = entries[0] as PerformanceEventTiming;
   ```

### **Result**
‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Frontend now builds and deploys successfully to Vercel.
