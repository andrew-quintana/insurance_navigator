# Phase 4 Execution Prompt: Comprehensive Local Integration Testing

## Context
You are implementing Phase 4 of the 003 Worker Refactor iteration. This phase implements comprehensive local integration testing to validate complete pipeline functionality before any deployment activities, ensuring the failures experienced in 002 are prevented through thorough local validation.

## Documentation References
Please review these documents before starting implementation:
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/CONTEXT003.md` - Comprehensive testing strategy and local validation approach
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TODO003.md` - Detailed implementation checklist (Phase 4 section)
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/RFC003.md` - Technical design for comprehensive testing framework
- `@TODO003_phase3_notes.md` - Phase 3 BaseWorker implementation details
- `@TODO003_phase3_decisions.md` - Previous processing architecture decisions
- `@TODO003_phase3_handoff.md` - Local validation requirements from Phase 3
- All previous phase outputs for complete context
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/002/POSTMORTEM002.md` - Lessons learned to prevent

## Primary Objective
**IMPLEMENT** comprehensive local integration testing to validate complete pipeline functionality before deployment. All implementation requirements, testing specifications, and detailed checklists are defined in the referenced documents.

## Expected Outputs
Document your work in these files:
- `@TODO003_phase4_notes.md` - Comprehensive testing results and validation coverage
- `@TODO003_phase4_decisions.md` - Testing strategies, outcomes, and optimization decisions
- `@TODO003_phase4_handoff.md` - Deployment preparation requirements for Phase 5
- `@TODO003_phase4_testing_summary.md` - Final validation results and performance benchmarks

## Implementation Approach
1. **Read all documentation thoroughly** - Review CONTEXT003.md testing strategy, RFC003.md testing framework, TODO003.md Phase 4, POSTMORTEM002.md, and all previous phase outputs
2. **Follow the detailed checklist** - Use TODO003.md Phase 4 section as your step-by-step implementation guide
3. **Reference testing specifications** - Use RFC003.md Comprehensive Testing Strategy section for technical implementation
4. **Build upon all previous phases** - Use complete local environment, infrastructure validation, and BaseWorker implementation

Start by reading all referenced documentation and previous phase outputs, then implement comprehensive local integration testing following the detailed Phase 4 checklist and validation requirements.
