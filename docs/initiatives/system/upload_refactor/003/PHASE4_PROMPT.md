- Build complete documentation and handoff materials for deployment preparation

## Expected Outputs
Document your work in these files:
- `@TODO003_phase4_notes.md` - Comprehensive testing results and validation coverage
- `@TODO003_phase4_decisions.md` - Testing strategies, outcomes, and optimization decisions
- `@TODO003_phase4_handoff.md` - Deployment preparation requirements for Phase 5
- `@TODO003_phase4_testing_summary.md` - Final validation results and performance benchmarks

## Success Criteria
