## Context & Overview

This TODO provides detailed implementation tasks for the 003 Worker Refactor iteration, implementing a local-first development approach with Docker-based testing environments. The implementation prioritizes comprehensive local validation, infrastructure verification, and incremental deployment with extensive testing at each phase.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete Docker-based local development environment replicating production architecture
- Infrastructure validation framework with automated deployment verification
- Enhanced BaseWorker implementation with comprehensive monitoring and observability
- Extended phase structure ensuring proper validation before deployment

**Technical Approach:**
- Local environment setup and validation before any deployment activities
- Infrastructure as code with automated validation and rollback procedures
- State machine implementation with comprehensive testing and monitoring
- Production deployment only after complete local validation

**Lessons from 002 Integration:**
- Local testing must precede deployment-based integration testing
- Infrastructure configuration requires explicit validation independent of application code
- Silent failures must be prevented through comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Each phase must have objective validation criteria before proceeding

## Implementation Notes

**Local-First Development Strategy:**
This TODO is designed for execution across 8 phases with comprehensive local validation before any deployment activities. The local-first approach ensures that all functionality is validated in a controlled environment before production deployment.

**Extended Phase Structure:**
The 8-phase structure provides proper validation and testing at each stage, preventing the deployment and infrastructure failures experienced in 002. Each phase includes comprehensive validation criteria and objective success measures.

**Session Management:**
- Always run `/clear` before starting a new phase
- Each phase includes complete context for fresh Claude sessions
- Save all specified output files for continuity between phases
- Reference previous phase outputs using `filename.md` syntax

**Quality Assurance:**
- Each phase includes comprehensive testing and validation requirements
- Local environment serves as deployment baseline and validation target
- Detailed documentation maintains project continuity and knowledge transfer
- Final validation confirms all success criteria are met before project completion

**Infrastructure Safety:**
- Infrastructure validation before application deployment
- Comprehensive rollback procedures tested in local environment
- Automated validation that deployed systems match local baseline
- Continuous monitoring and alerting for production reliability

**Future Extensibility:**
The local-first architecture facilitates future improvements including:
- Migration to managed cloud platforms with validated local baseline
- Integration with external queue services validated in local environment
- Multi-model embedding support tested locally before deployment
- Advanced processing stages developed and validated locally first
