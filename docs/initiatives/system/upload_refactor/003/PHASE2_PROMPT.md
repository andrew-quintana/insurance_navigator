# Phase 2 Execution Prompt: Infrastructure Validation Framework

## Context
You are implementing Phase 2 of the 003 Worker Refactor iteration. This phase implements infrastructure validation framework to prevent the deployment configuration failures experienced in 002, with automated validation of deployment infrastructure against local environment baseline.

## Documentation References
Please review these documents before starting implementation:
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/CONTEXT003.md` - Infrastructure validation strategy and framework architecture
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TODO003.md` - Detailed implementation checklist (Phase 2 section)
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/RFC003.md` - Technical design for infrastructure validation framework
- `TODO003_phase1_notes.md` - Phase 1 local environment implementation details
- `TODO003_phase1_decisions.md` - Previous technical choices and baseline configuration
- `TODO003_phase1_handoff.md` - Infrastructure validation requirements from Phase 1

## Primary Objective
**IMPLEMENT** the infrastructure validation framework as specified in the documentation. All implementation requirements, technical specifications, and detailed checklists are defined in the referenced documents.

## Expected Outputs
Document your work in these files:
- `TODO003_phase2_notes.md` - Infrastructure validation implementation details and framework architecture
- `TODO003_phase2_decisions.md` - Validation strategy decisions and technical trade-offs
- `TODO003_phase2_handoff.md` - BaseWorker implementation requirements for Phase 3
- `TODO003_phase2_testing_summary.md` - Infrastructure testing results and validation coverage

## Implementation Approach
1. **Read all documentation thoroughly** - Review CONTEXT003.md, RFC003.md, TODO003.md Phase 2, and previous phase outputs
2. **Follow the detailed checklist** - Use TODO003.md Phase 2 section as your step-by-step implementation guide
3. **Reference technical specifications** - Use RFC003.md Infrastructure Validation Framework section for technical design
4. **Build upon Phase 1** - Use previous phase outputs as baseline configuration

Start by reading all referenced documentation and previous phase outputs, then implement the infrastructure validation framework following the detailed Phase 2 checklist and validation requirements.
