# Phase 7 Execution Prompt: Production Deployment and Integration

## Context
You are implementing Phase 7 of the 003 Worker Refactor iteration. This phase implements production deployment with comprehensive validation against local environment baseline, followed by production integration with comprehensive monitoring and operational excellence. This phase focuses on deploying to production, validating functionality matches local behavior, and establishing long-term reliability and maintainability.

## Documentation References
Please review these documents before starting implementation:
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/CONTEXT003.md` - Production deployment strategy and operational excellence framework
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TODO003.md` - Detailed implementation checklist (Phase 7 section)
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/RFC003.md` - Technical design for production deployment and integration
- `TODO003_phase6_notes.md` - Phase 6 local environment completion and testing infrastructure details
- `TODO003_phase6_decisions.md` - Testing infrastructure decisions and trade-offs
- `TODO003_phase6_handoff.md` - Production deployment requirements from Phase 6
- All previous phase outputs for complete operational context
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/PRD003.md` - Success metrics and SLA requirements

## Primary Objective
**IMPLEMENT** production deployment with comprehensive validation against local environment baseline, followed by production integration with operational excellence and long-term reliability. All implementation requirements, technical specifications, and detailed checklists are defined in the referenced documents.

## Implementation Approach
1. **Read all documentation thoroughly** - Review CONTEXT003.md production deployment strategy, RFC003.md, TODO003.md Phase 7, PRD003.md, and all previous phase outputs
2. **Follow the detailed checklist** - Use TODO003.md Phase 7 section as your step-by-step implementation guide
3. **Reference local environment baseline** - Use Phase 6 local environment as validation baseline for production deployment
4. **Implement production deployment** - Deploy applications to production infrastructure with comprehensive validation

## Expected Outputs
Document your work in these files:
- **`TODO003_phase7_notes.md`** - Production deployment details and operational procedures
- **`TODO003_phase7_decisions.md`** - Production deployment decisions and monitoring framework
- **`TODO003_phase7_handoff.md`** - Ongoing maintenance requirements for Phase 8
- **`TODO003_phase7_testing_summary.md`** - Production validation results and SLA compliance

Start by reading all referenced documentation and previous phase outputs, then implement production deployment following the detailed Phase 7 checklist and comprehensive validation requirements.
