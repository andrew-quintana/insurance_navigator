# Phase 7 Execution Prompt: Production Integration and Monitoring

## Context
You are implementing Phase 7 of the 003 Worker Refactor iteration. This phase implements production integration with comprehensive monitoring and operational excellence, establishing long-term reliability and performance optimization for the deployed system.

## Documentation References
Please review these documents before starting implementation:
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/CONTEXT003.md` - Production integration strategy and operational excellence framework
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TODO003.md` - Detailed implementation checklist (Phase 7 section)
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/RFC003.md` - Technical design for production integration and monitoring
- `TODO003_phase6_notes.md` - Phase 6 application deployment details and verification results
- `TODO003_phase6_decisions.md` - Production deployment decisions and configuration
- `TODO003_phase6_handoff.md` - Production operation requirements from Phase 6
- All previous phase outputs for complete operational context
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/PRD003.md` - Success metrics and SLA requirements

## Primary Objective
**IMPLEMENT** production integration with operational excellence and long-term reliability. All implementation requirements, technical specifications, and detailed checklists are defined in the referenced documents.

## Implementation Approach
1. **Read all documentation thoroughly** - Review CONTEXT003.md operational excellence, RFC003.md, TODO003.md Phase 7, PRD003.md, and all previous phase outputs
2. **Follow the detailed checklist** - Use TODO003.md Phase 7 section as your step-by-step implementation guide
3. **Reference operational framework** - Use CONTEXT003.md sections on operational excellence and monitoring
4. **Establish long-term procedures** - Focus on sustainable operational practices and continuous improvement

## Expected Outputs
Document your work in these files:
- `TODO003_phase7_notes.md` - Production integration details and operational procedures
- `TODO003_phase7_decisions.md` - Operational strategy decisions and monitoring framework
- `TODO003_phase7_handoff.md` - Ongoing maintenance requirements for Phase 8
- `TODO003_phase7_testing_summary.md` - Production performance validation and SLA compliance


Start by reading all referenced documentation and previous phase outputs, then implement production integration following the detailed Phase 7 checklist and operational excellence requirements.
