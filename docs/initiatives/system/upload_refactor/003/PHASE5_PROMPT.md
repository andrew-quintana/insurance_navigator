# Phase 5 Execution Prompt: Infrastructure Deployment and Validation

## Context
You are implementing Phase 5 of the 003 Worker Refactor iteration. This phase implements infrastructure deployment with automated validation against the local environment baseline, addressing the infrastructure configuration failures that caused 002 implementation breakdown.

## Documentation References
Please review these documents before starting implementation:
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/CONTEXT003.md` - Infrastructure deployment strategy and validation framework
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TODO003.md` - Detailed implementation checklist (Phase 5 section)
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/RFC003.md` - Technical design for infrastructure deployment and validation
- `@TODO003_phase4_notes.md` - Phase 4 comprehensive testing results and baseline validation
- `@TODO003_phase4_decisions.md` - Testing strategies and deployment preparation decisions
- `@TODO003_phase4_handoff.md` - Deployment preparation requirements from Phase 4
- `@TODO003_phase2_notes.md` - Infrastructure validation framework implementation
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/002/POSTMORTEM002.md` - Infrastructure failures to prevent

## Primary Objective
**IMPLEMENT** infrastructure deployment with automated validation against local environment baseline. All implementation requirements, technical specifications, and detailed checklists are defined in the referenced documents.

## Expected Outputs
Document your work in these files:
- `@TODO003_phase5_notes.md` - Infrastructure deployment details and configuration decisions
- `@TODO003_phase5_decisions.md` - Infrastructure architecture choices and trade-offs
- `@TODO003_phase5_handoff.md` - Application deployment requirements for Phase 6
- `@TODO003_phase5_testing_summary.md` - Infrastructure validation results and performance benchmarks

## Implementation Approach
1. **Read all documentation thoroughly** - Review CONTEXT003.md deployment strategy, RFC003.md infrastructure sections, TODO003.md Phase 5, POSTMORTEM002.md, and all previous phase outputs
2. **Follow the detailed checklist** - Use TODO003.md Phase 5 section as your step-by-step implementation guide
3. **Reference validation framework** - Use Phase 2 infrastructure validation framework for deployment validation
4. **Validate against baseline** - Ensure deployed infrastructure matches local environment configuration exactly

Start by reading all referenced documentation and previous phase outputs, then implement infrastructure deployment following the detailed Phase 5 checklist and comprehensive validation requirements.
