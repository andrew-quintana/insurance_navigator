# Phase 5 Execution Prompt: Infrastructure Deployment and Validation

## Context
You are implementing Phase 5 of the 003 Worker Refactor iteration. This phase implements infrastructure deployment with automated validation against the local environment baseline, addressing the infrastructure configuration failures that caused 002 implementation breakdown.

## Documentation References

- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/RFC003.md` - Technical design for infrastructure deployment and validation
- `@TODO003_phase4_notes.md` - Phase 4 comprehensive testing results and baseline validation
- `@TODO003_phase4_decisions.md` - Testing strategies and deployment preparation decisions
- `@TODO003_phase4_handoff.md` - Deployment preparation requirements from Phase 4

## Primary Objective
Implement infrastructure deployment with automated validation including:
1. Infrastructure deployment automation with configuration management
2. Service configuration and validation against local baseline
3. Database and storage infrastructure with performance validation
4. Infrastructure health monitoring and automated rollback procedures

## Key Implementation Requirements

### Infrastructure Deployment Automation
- Implement automated infrastructure deployment with version-controlled configuration management
- Create deployment validation against local environment baseline with comprehensive checks
- Develop infrastructure health monitoring and status validation systems
- Build automated rollback procedures for infrastructure failures with safety measures

### Service Configuration and Validation
- Deploy and configure all required infrastructure services with proper dependencies
- Validate service connectivity and functionality against local baseline performance
- Implement environment configuration management and validation frameworks
- Create infrastructure monitoring and alerting systems with real-time status updates

### Database and Storage Infrastructure
- Deploy and configure production database with vector extensions and buffer tables
- Set up storage infrastructure with proper security and access controls
- Validate database performance and functionality against local benchmarks
- Implement database monitoring, backup, and disaster recovery procedures

### Infrastructure Health and Monitoring
- Implement comprehensive infrastructure health monitoring with real-time alerting
- Create automated validation that infrastructure matches local environment configuration
- Develop alerting and notification systems for infrastructure issues and failures
- Build infrastructure documentation and operational procedures for team use

## Expected Outputs
Document your work in these files:
- `@TODO003_phase5_notes.md` - Infrastructure deployment details and configuration decisions
- `@TODO003_phase5_decisions.md` - Infrastructure architecture choices and trade-offs
- `@TODO003_phase5_handoff.md` - Application deployment requirements for Phase 6
- `@TODO003_phase5_testing_summary.md` - Infrastructure validation results and performance benchmarks

## Success Criteria
- Infrastructure deployment completes successfully with all services operational and validated
- Automated validation confirms infrastructure configuration matches local environment baseline
- Database and storage infrastructure performance meets or exceeds local benchmarks
- Infrastructure health monitoring provides real-time status with comprehensive alerting
- Rollback procedures tested and validated with automated failure detection
- All infrastructure services pass connectivity and functionality validation checks

## Implementation Notes
- Use the infrastructure validation framework developed in Phase 2 as your deployment foundation
- Validate all infrastructure configuration against the local environment baseline established in Phase 1-4
- Focus on preventing the infrastructure configuration gaps that caused 002 failures
- Ensure no worker processes or applications are missing from the deployment
- Implement comprehensive monitoring to detect configuration drift and service failures
- Document all infrastructure configuration and operational procedures

## Critical Validation Points
- **Infrastructure Completeness**: All required services deployed and operational (no missing workers like 002)
- **Configuration Validation**: Deployment configuration matches local environment baseline exactly
- **Performance Validation**: Infrastructure performance meets or exceeds local benchmarks
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring operational with real-time alerting
- **Rollback Capability**: Automated rollback procedures tested and ready for activation
- **Service Connectivity**: All services communicate properly with validated networking and dependencies

Start by reading all referenced documentation and previous phase outputs, then implement infrastructure deployment following the detailed Phase 5 checklist and comprehensive validation requirements.
