# PRD003: Worker Refactor - Local-First Implementation with Docker-Based Development

## Context & Background

This PRD defines the product requirements for the 003 Worker Refactor iteration, building upon the architectural design from 002 while addressing critical implementation and testing failures identified in the 002 post-mortem. The primary focus is implementing a local-first development approach with Docker-based testing environments before any deployment activities.

**Previous Iteration Context:** The 002 implementation revealed fundamental gaps in infrastructure validation, testing strategy, and deployment verification. While the architectural design was sound, implementation failures highlighted the need for comprehensive local testing capabilities and proper infrastructure management.

**Reference Documents:**
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/002/POSTMORTEM002.md` - Lessons learned from 002 failures
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/002/CONTEXT002.md` - Architectural foundation to build upon
- `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/002/PRD002.md` - Original requirements and success metrics

## Problem Statement

**002 Implementation Failures:**
- No functional worker processes despite "successful" deployment
- Complete pipeline breakdown masked by inadequate testing
- Infrastructure configuration gaps preventing actual processing
- Testing disconnected from real deployment behavior
- Silent failures in state machine transitions and buffer operations

**Development Environment Challenges:**
- Integration testing dependent on unreliable deployment infrastructure
- No local environment for complete pipeline validation
- Deployment-first approach causing late discovery of fundamental issues
- Inadequate monitoring and observability for early problem detection

**User Impact:**
- Insurance professionals experience 0% success rate for document processing
- Upload operations appear successful but never complete processing
- No visibility into actual processing failures vs. expected behavior
- Complete breakdown of core document ingestion functionality

## Success Metrics

**Primary KPIs (Updated from 002 with focus on validation):**
- **Local Pipeline Reliability**: >99% success rate in local Docker environment before deployment
- **Infrastructure Validation**: 100% of deployment components verified working before feature implementation
- **End-to-End Validation**: Complete pipeline tested locally with real external service integration
- **Deployment Verification**: Objective validation that deployed system matches local behavior

**Secondary Metrics:**
- **Development Velocity**: 50% faster iteration through local testing capabilities
- **Issue Detection**: Critical failures detected in local environment, not production
- **Testing Coverage**: 100% of state machine transitions validated locally
- **Infrastructure Reliability**: Zero configuration drift between local and deployment environments

**Validation Metrics (New for 003):**
- **Local Environment Setup Time**: <30 minutes for complete pipeline setup
- **Test Execution Time**: <5 minutes for complete end-to-end local test
- **Deployment Confidence**: 100% of deployments verified against local baseline
