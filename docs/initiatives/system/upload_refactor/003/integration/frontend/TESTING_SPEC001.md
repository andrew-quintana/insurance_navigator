## Test Types

### Unit Tests
**Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library
**Coverage Target**: 85%

**Components to Test:**
- `DocumentUpload.tsx` - File validation, upload initiation, progress tracking
- `DocumentManager.tsx` - Document list, status updates, deletion
- `DocumentUploadModal.tsx` - Modal behavior, form validation
- `DocumentUploadServerless.tsx` - Serverless upload flow
- `app/chat/page.tsx` - Chat interface, message handling
- `lib/api-client.ts` - API call functions, error handling
- `lib/supabase-client.ts` - Authentication integration

**Test Cases:**
- File type validation (PDF, DOCX acceptance/rejection)
- File size limits enforcement
- Upload progress state management
- Error state handling and display
- Authentication state changes
- API response parsing and error handling

### Integration Tests
**Framework**: Playwright + Custom Test Harness
**Environment**: Docker Compose Mock Integration

**Test Scenarios:**
- **Authentication Integration**: Login/registration → protected route access → session management
- **Upload → Processing Flow**: Authenticated file upload through completion with status updates  
- **Agent API Integration**: Chat interface calling agent endpoints with authenticated user context
- **Document-Agent Bridge**: User-owned uploaded documents available in agent RAG queries
- **Error Recovery**: Network failures, timeout handling, retry mechanisms with auth
- **Session Management**: Auth token refresh during long upload/conversation sessions
- **Authorization**: User can only access their own documents and conversations

**Mock Data Strategy:**
- **Stage 1 (Mock APIs)**: Simulated upload responses, mock agent conversations
- **Stage 2 (Integration)**: Real upload pipeline + mock agents for controlled responses
- **Stage 3 (Full Integration)**: Complete system with real document processing + agents

### End-to-End Tests  
**Framework**: Playwright
**Environment**: Full Docker Compose Stack

**Critical User Journeys:**
1. **Authentication Flow (Foundation)**:
   - New user registration with email validation
   - Existing user login with credentials
   - Session persistence across browser refresh
   - Protected route access (upload/chat requires auth)
   - Logout and session cleanup
   - Password reset flow
   - Authentication error handling (invalid credentials, expired sessions)

2. **Complete Upload → Conversation Flow**:
   - User registers/logs in (authenticated session)
   - Uploads insurance document (PDF) with auth headers
   - Waits for processing completion with status updates
   - Initiates chat about uploaded document with user context
   - Agent provides relevant responses using document content
   - Session maintained throughout entire flow

3. **Multi-Document Management**:
   - Authenticated user uploads multiple documents
   - Document list filtered by user ownership
   - Document deletion with ownership verification
   - Chat queries spanning user's multiple documents
   - Session-aware document access control

4. **Error Handling Scenarios**:
   - Authentication failures during operations
   - Session expiry during long uploads/conversations
   - Invalid file upload attempts with proper auth
   - Network interruption during upload with token refresh
   - Processing failures with user-specific notifications
   - Agent service unavailability graceful degradation

5. **Performance Validation**:
   - Authenticated large document upload (10MB+ PDF)
   - Concurrent authenticated users (5 users)
   - Extended authenticated conversation sessions (10+ messages)
   - Token refresh during long operations

### Load/Performance Tests (Limited MVP Scope)
**Framework**: Artillery.js + Custom Metrics
**Target**: MVP-appropriate load validation

**Test Scenarios:**
- **Concurrent Uploads**: 10 simultaneous document uploads
- **Chat Performance**: Response times under 5 seconds for document queries
- **Memory Stability**: No memory leaks during extended UI sessions  
- **File Size Handling**: Upload performance with documents up to 50MB
- **Browser Resource Usage**: CPU/memory impact during upload + chat

**Performance Thresholds:**
- Upload initiation: < 2 seconds
- Document processing notification: < 30 seconds for typical documents  
- Agent response time: < 5 seconds
- UI responsiveness: No blocking operations > 1 second
- Memory usage: Stable after 1-hour session

## Coverage Goals
