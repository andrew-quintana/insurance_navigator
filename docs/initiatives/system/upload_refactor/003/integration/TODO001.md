# TODO001: Upload Pipeline + Agent Workflow Integration - Implementation Tasks

## Document Context
This TODO document provides detailed implementation tasks for integrating the 003 Worker Refactor upload pipeline with patient navigator agent workflows, based on the requirements in PRD001.md and technical design in RFC001.md.

**Reference Documents**:
- `PRD001.md` - Product requirements and success criteria
- `RFC001.md` - Technical architecture and design decisions
- `CONTEXT001.md` - Integration context and current state analysis

## Implementation Overview

The integration will be completed in 3 phases over 3 weeks, focusing on robust MVP delivery that connects two separately developed systems. The approach emphasizes direct vector access (no bridge schema), unified development environment, and comprehensive automated testing.

**Key Success Criteria**:
- End-to-end flow: upload â†’ agent conversation <90 seconds
- Integration test success rate >95%  
- Development environment setup <15 minutes
- Agent response accuracy >95% with processed documents

## Phase 1: Mock Integration Setup & Testing (Week 1)
**Objective**: Establish integration using mock services and debug until end-to-end flow works

### Setup Tasks

#### T1.1: Mock Integration Environment Setup
**Deliverable**: Docker Compose stack with mock services for integration testing
**Time Estimate**: 2 days
**Priority**: Critical

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Create mock integration Docker Compose configuration**
   ```yaml
   # File: docker-compose.mock-integration.yml
   - Extend existing 003 Docker stack
   - Add agent API service container
   - Configure shared database with upload_pipeline schema
   - Set up mock LlamaParse and OpenAI services
   - Configure network connectivity between all services
   ```

2. **Database schema integration**
   ```sql
   -- File: sql/integration_schema_setup.sql
   - Apply upload_pipeline schema (from 003)
   - Add document_type column to documents table
   - Create pgvector indexes optimized for RAG queries
   - Apply Row Level Security policies for agent access
   - Create database functions for document availability checks
   ```

3. **Mock environment automation script**
   ```bash
   # File: scripts/setup-mock-integration-environment.sh
   - Launch Docker Compose stack with mock services
   - Wait for database readiness
   - Apply schema migrations

./scripts/validate-mock-environment-health.sh  # All checks pass
```

#### T1.2: Agent RAG Configuration for upload_pipeline Access
**Deliverable**: Agent workflows configured to query upload_pipeline vectors directly
**Time Estimate**: 1.5 days
**Priority**: Critical

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Modify RAGTool configuration**
   ```python
   # File: agents/tooling/rag/upload_pipeline_config.py
   class UploadPipelineRAGConfig(RetrievalConfig):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__()
           self.schema_name = "upload_pipeline"
           self.chunks_table = "document_chunks"
           self.chunks_id_column = "chunk_id"
           self.embedding_column = "embedding_vector"
           self.content_column = "chunk_text"
           self.metadata_column = "chunk_metadata"
           self.user_id_column = "user_id"
   ```

2. **Update agent database connections**
   ```python
   # File: agents/patient_navigator/shared/database.py
   - Configure connection to upload_pipeline schema
   - Implement connection pooling for concurrent access
   - Add user access validation for RAG queries
   - Create helper functions for document availability checks
   ```

3. **Information Retrieval Agent integration**
   ```python
   # File: agents/patient_navigator/information_retrieval/agent.py
   - Update RAGTool initialization to use UploadPipelineRAGConfig
   - Modify query methods to target upload_pipeline.document_chunks
   - Implement error handling for upload_pipeline access
   - Add logging for RAG query performance monitoring
   ```

4. **Supervisor Workflow document availability check**
   ```python
   # File: agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/document_checker.py
   def check_document_availability(self, user_id: str) -> Dict[str, bool]:
       """Check for presence of specific document types (e.g., 'policy')"""
       query = """
           SELECT DISTINCT document_type, COUNT(*) as doc_count
           FROM upload_pipeline.documents 
           WHERE user_id = $1 
             AND document_id IN (
               SELECT document_id FROM upload_pipeline.upload_jobs 
               WHERE status = 'complete'
             )
           GROUP BY document_type
       """
       # Return dict of document_type -> available boolean
   ```

**Acceptance Criteria**:

    # Execute information retrieval agent query
    # Validate results reference processed document content
    # Check query performance within targets
```

#### T1.3: Unified Mock Service Configuration (Development/Testing Only)
**Deliverable**: Coordinated mock services providing consistent responses during development and testing phases
**Time Estimate**: 1 day  
**Priority**: High

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Shared mock service configuration**
   ```python
   # File: backend/mocks/unified_mock_config.py
   class UnifiedMockConfig:
       def __init__(self):
           self.deterministic_seed = True
           self.llamaparse_delay = 2.0  # seconds
           self.openai_delay = 0.5      # seconds
           self.failure_rate = 0.0      # for testing error scenarios
           # NOTE: Mock services used only for development and testing
           
   # Ensure consistent responses based on document_id hash for testing
   def generate_deterministic_content(document_id: str) -> str:
       seed = hashlib.md5(document_id.encode()).hexdigest()
       # Generate consistent mock content for testing only
   ```

2. **Mock LlamaParse service updates** (Development/Testing Only)
   ```python
   # File: backend/mocks/llamaparse_mock.py
   # NOTE: Mock service for development and testing phases only
   - Use unified configuration for response generation during testing
   - Ensure webhook callbacks work with agent system testing
   - Add deterministic content generation based on document_id
   - Implement configurable processing delays for testing scenarios
   ```

3. **Mock OpenAI service updates** (Development/Testing Only)
   ```python
   # File: backend/mocks/openai_mock.py
   # NOTE: Mock service for development and testing phases only
   - Generate consistent embeddings for same text input during testing
   - Support both upload pipeline and agent system embedding requests
   - Implement configurable rate limiting simulation for testing
   - Add batch embedding support for agent workflow testing
   ```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Same document_id produces identical content across all mock services
- [ ] Same text produces identical embeddings across upload and agent calls
- [ ] Mock services support both upload pipeline and agent system request patterns during development
- [ ] All mock services use unified configuration management for testing phases
- [ ] Mock service responses are deterministic for integration testing (production uses real APIs)

**Testing**:
```python
# File: tests/integration/test_unified_mocks.py
async def test_mock_service_consistency():
    # NOTE: Test mock services during development phase only
    # Upload document through 003 pipeline with mocks
    # Query same document through agent system with mocks  
    # Validate identical responses for identical inputs during testing
    # Check mock service coordination for development environment
```
