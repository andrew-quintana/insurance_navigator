## Overview
This document records the key technical decisions made during Phase 2 of the upload pipeline + agent workflow integration project. Each decision includes the rationale, alternatives considered, and implementation details for real API integration.

## Decision 1: Comprehensive Real API Error Handling Architecture

### Decision Made
Implement a structured error handling system with error classification, automatic retry logic, and cost monitoring specifically designed for real API integration challenges.

### Rationale
- **Real API Complexity**: Real APIs have different failure modes than mock services (rate limiting, authentication, network issues)
- **Production Readiness**: Robust error handling is essential for production deployment
- **Cost Management**: Real API usage incurs costs that need monitoring and control
- **User Experience**: Proper error handling maintains system stability and user experience
- **Debugging Support**: Structured error handling provides clear debugging information

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Basic Error Handling**: Simple try-catch blocks with basic logging
   - *Rejected*: Insufficient for production use, doesn't handle real API complexities
2. **External Error Handling Library**: Use existing error handling libraries
   - *Rejected*: May not be specific to our integration needs, adds unnecessary dependencies
3. **Mock-Style Error Handling**: Extend mock error handling to real APIs
   - *Rejected*: Mock errors don't represent real API failure modes

### Rationale
- **Transient Failures**: Many real API failures are transient and can be resolved with retries
- **Rate Limiting**: Rate limits can be handled with appropriate backoff strategies
- **Network Issues**: Network connectivity issues often resolve with retries
- **User Experience**: Automatic retry improves user experience and system reliability
- **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent retry prevents unnecessary API calls for permanent failures

### Alternatives Considered
1. **No Retry Logic**: Fail immediately on any error
