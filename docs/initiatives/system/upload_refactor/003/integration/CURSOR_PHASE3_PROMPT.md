# Phase 3: Documentation & Handoff - Cursor Agent Prompt

## Context & Objective
You are implementing Phase 3 of the Upload Pipeline + Agent Workflow Integration project. Your goal is to create comprehensive documentation for the integrated system and prepare complete handoff materials for ongoing development team use.

**Prerequisites**: Phases 1 and 2 must be completed successfully with all integration tests passing using both mock and real APIs.

**Key Focus**: Document the production-ready integration, operational procedures, and technical knowledge transfer for sustained development team usage.

## Primary Documentation Sources
**CRITICAL**: Reference these documents and Phase 1/2 deliverables:
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/integration/PRD001.md` - Product requirements and success criteria
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/integration/RFC001.md` - Technical architecture reference
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/integration/TODO001.md` - Complete task breakdown
- `TODO001_phase1_handoff.md` - Phase 1 deliverables and mock integration results
- `TODO001_phase2_handoff.md` - Phase 2 deliverables and real API integration results

## Phase 3 Success Criteria
✅ **Complete Technical Documentation**: Comprehensive setup, operation, and troubleshooting guides  
✅ **Operational Procedures**: Deployment, monitoring, and incident response documentation  
✅ **Knowledge Transfer**: Development team can independently operate and extend the integrated system  
✅ **Technical Debt Documentation**: Complete analysis of integration shortcuts and future optimization needs
