# Phase 3: Documentation & Handoff - Cursor Agent Prompt

## Objective
Document integrated system comprehensively and prepare for ongoing development team use. Complete final validation and create handoff materials.

## Required Reading
**Read these documents and all Phase deliverables:**
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/integration/PRD001.md` - Success criteria validation
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/integration/RFC001.md` - Architecture documentation requirements
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/integration/TODO001.md` - Phase 3 tasks (P3.1-P3.6)
- `TODO001_phase1_handoff.md` - Phase 1 deliverables and issues
- `TODO001_phase2_handoff.md` - Phase 2 deliverables and performance results

## Key Documentation Tasks
1. **Integration Setup Guide**: Complete environment setup and operation procedures
2. **Troubleshooting Documentation**: Common issues and resolution procedures from Phases 1-2
3. **Technical Debt Summary**: Compile `INTEGRATION_TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` from phase experiences
4. **Performance Baseline**: Document performance characteristics and optimization opportunities
5. **Operational Procedures**: Deployment, monitoring, and incident response procedures
6. **Final Validation**: Ensure all PRD001.md acceptance criteria are met

## Success Criteria
- Complete documentation suite enables new developers to set up integrated environment <15 minutes
- All PRD001.md acceptance criteria validated and documented
- Technical debt and future enhancement roadmap clearly documented
- Integration test suite provides feedback <10 minutes consistently

## Documentation to Create
Complete comprehensive documentation package:
- `TODO001_phase3_notes.md` - Documentation completion and final validation summary
- `TODO001_phase3_decisions.md` - Final architectural and operational decisions
- `TODO001_phase3_testing_summary.md` - Final integration test results and performance baselines
- `TODO001_phase3_handoff.md` - Complete integration handoff to development team
- `INTEGRATION_TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` - Technical debt summary and prioritization
- `INTEGRATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Complete environment setup and operation guide
- `INTEGRATION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues and resolution procedures

## Technical Focus
- Consolidate learnings from both mock and real API testing phases
- Document performance baselines and optimization opportunities
- Create reproducible setup procedures based on actual implementation experience
- Establish monitoring and maintenance procedures for ongoing use

Focus on creating documentation that enables the development team to confidently use and maintain the integrated system.
