## Key Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Real API Error Handling Strategy
- **Decision**: Implement comprehensive error handling with structured error types and retry logic
- **Rationale**: Real APIs have different failure modes than mocks, requiring robust error handling
- **Implementation**: Structured error handling with automatic retry, rate limiting management, and cost tracking

### 2. Performance Monitoring Architecture
- **Decision**: Implement real-time performance monitoring with alerting and cost tracking
- **Rationale**: Real API performance characteristics differ from mocks, requiring continuous monitoring
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive metrics collection with rolling windows, alerting thresholds, and cost monitoring

### 3. Test Environment Configuration
- **Decision**: Separate Docker Compose configuration for real API testing
- **Rationale**: Real API testing requires different configuration and cannot use mock services
- **Implementation**: Dedicated real API environment with proper credential management and service configuration

### 4. Error Recovery and Retry Logic
- **Decision**: Implement intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff and error classification
- **Rationale**: Real APIs have transient failures that can be resolved with retries
- **Implementation**: Configurable retry strategies based on error type with proper backoff timing
