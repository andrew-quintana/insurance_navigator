# PRD001: Upload Pipeline + Agent Workflow Integration (MVP)

## Document Context
This PRD defines the product requirements for integrating the completed 003 Worker Refactor upload pipeline infrastructure with patient navigator agent workflows, enabling end-to-end document processing and intelligent conversation capabilities.

**Reference Context**: `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/integration/CONTEXT001.md`

## Problem Statement

Healthcare consumers and insurance professionals require a seamless experience where uploaded insurance documents are immediately queryable through intelligent agent conversations. Currently, two robust systems exist in isolation:

1. **003 Upload Pipeline**: Production-ready document processing infrastructure with >99% reliability, complete Docker-based local development, and comprehensive vector storage capabilities
2. **Agent Workflows**: Multiple production-ready patient navigator agents (information retrieval, strategy, supervisor) with RAG integration patterns

**Key Pain Points:**
- **Disconnected Systems**: Documents processed through upload pipeline are not accessible to agent conversations
- **Manual Integration Overhead**: No automated pipeline from document completion to agent RAG availability  
- **Development Environment Complexity**: Separate testing environments prevent comprehensive validation
- **Performance Uncertainty**: Unknown integration overhead between upload processing and agent query performance
- **Quality Validation Gap**: No automated testing of conversation quality using processed documents

**User Impact:**
- Insurance professionals cannot immediately query uploaded policy documents through intelligent agents
- Users experience delays between document upload and conversational access
- Development teams lack confidence in integrated system reliability
- No validation that processed documents enhance agent conversation quality

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **End-to-End Flow Performance**: Upload to agent-queryable <90 seconds (003 baseline: <60s + integration overhead)
- **Agent Response Quality**: >95% accuracy in referencing processed document content in conversations
- **Integration Reliability**: >95% success rate for automated integration tests
- **Development Velocity**: <15 minutes for complete integrated environment setup
- **System Performance**: <20% performance degradation under concurrent upload and agent operations

### Secondary Metrics
