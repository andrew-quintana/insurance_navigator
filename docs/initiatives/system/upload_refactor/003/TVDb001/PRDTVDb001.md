# PRDTVDb001: Real API Integration Testing & Validation

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the requirements for validating real external service integrations (LlamaParse, OpenAI) in the document processing pipeline, building upon the successful Upload Refactor 003 local-first development foundation. This effort represents a focused validation phase to replace mock services with real APIs in the local environment before any production deployment.

**Project Context**: This initiative succeeds Upload Refactor 003, leveraging its robust Docker-based local environment and comprehensive testing infrastructure. The 003 iteration achieved 100% success through local-first validation with mock services; TVDb001 extends this approach to validate real external service behavior in the same controlled environment.

## Problem Statement

### Context from Upload Refactor 003 Success

Upload Refactor 003 achieved 100% success criteria through comprehensive local validation using mock services. The mock services provided deterministic, reliable testing that enabled:
- 58% improvement in development velocity
- 25-minute local environment setup (target: <30 minutes)
- 3.5-minute comprehensive test execution (target: <5 minutes)
- >99% local pipeline reliability

### Current Challenge

While mock services enabled successful local development and deployment confidence, production readiness requires validation of real external service behavior:

**LlamaParse Integration Gaps:**
- Mock service provides deterministic markdown output from test fixtures
- Real service behavior includes variable response times, rate limiting, webhook timing
- Content quality and structure may differ from mock assumptions
- Error scenarios (timeouts, failures, malformed responses) need real validation

**OpenAI Integration Gaps:**
- Mock embeddings generated from deterministic algorithms
- Real service includes rate limiting, token counting, batch processing constraints
- Vector dimensions and quality differ from mock implementations
- Cost implications and usage monitoring not validated locally

**Pipeline Integration Risks:**
- Mock services hide potential integration failures at service boundaries
- Real webhook delivery timing may affect state machine transitions
- Error handling and recovery patterns need validation with actual service failures
- Performance characteristics may differ significantly from mock baseline

### User Impact Without Real Validation

**Development Team Impact:**
- Deployment surprises from untested real service behavior
- Difficulty debugging production issues without local reproduction capability
- Incomplete understanding of service constraints and error patterns
- Risk of deployment failures despite successful local validation

**Operations Team Impact:**
- Limited operational visibility into real external service behavior
- Inability to troubleshoot real API integration issues locally
- Unknown performance and reliability characteristics for production planning
- Insufficient monitoring and alerting for real service dependencies

**Business Impact:**
- Risk of production deployment failures affecting document processing reliability
- Unknown cost implications and usage patterns for external services
- Potential delays in production rollout due to unforeseen integration issues
- Reduced confidence in system behavior under real-world conditions
