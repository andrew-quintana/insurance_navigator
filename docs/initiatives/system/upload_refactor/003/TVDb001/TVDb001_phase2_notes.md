## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced Upload Endpoint Architecture

#### Service Router Integration
```python
@router.post("/upload", response_model=UploadResponse)
async def upload_document(
    request: UploadRequest,
    current_user: User = Depends(require_user())
):
    """Enhanced upload endpoint with service router integration"""
    
    # Generate correlation ID for tracking
    correlation_id = uuid4()
    
    # Get service router configuration
    service_router = get_service_router()
    
    # Check service availability and cost limits
    await _validate_service_availability(service_router, correlation_id)
    await _validate_cost_limits(request, correlation_id)
    
    # Create job with service mode tracking
    job = await _create_enhanced_job(
        request, current_user, service_router, correlation_id
    )
    
    # Trigger pipeline with service router
    await _trigger_pipeline(job, service_router, correlation_id)
    
    return job
```

#### Correlation ID Tracking
- **Generation**: Unique correlation ID generated for each upload request
- **Persistence**: Stored in job metadata and all related database records
- **Propagation**: Passed through all processing stages and external service calls
- **Monitoring**: Used for comprehensive request tracing and debugging

#### Service Mode Awareness
- **Mode Detection**: Automatic detection of current service mode from configuration
- **Service Selection**: Intelligent service selection based on mode and availability
- **Fallback Logic**: Automatic fallback to mock services when real services unavailable
- **Cost Control**: Service mode-specific cost limit enforcement

### Enhanced Job Creation

#### Job Metadata Enhancement
```python
class EnhancedUploadJob(Base):
    """Enhanced upload job with service integration tracking"""
    
    # Existing fields from 003
    job_id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True)
    user_id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), nullable=False)
    document_id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), nullable=False)
    status = Column(String, nullable=False)
    
    # New fields for service integration
    service_mode = Column(String, nullable=False, default='hybrid')
    correlation_id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), nullable=False)
    service_router_config = Column(JSON, nullable=False)
    cost_estimate = Column(JSON, nullable=True)
    processing_priority = Column(Integer, default=0)
    
    # Enhanced monitoring fields
    service_health_status = Column(JSON, nullable=True)
    cost_tracking_enabled = Column(Boolean, default=True)
    fallback_triggered = Column(Boolean, default=False)
```

#### Service Router Configuration Storage
- **Configuration Persistence**: Store service router configuration in job metadata
- **Mode Tracking**: Track service mode changes throughout job lifecycle
- **Health Status**: Store service health status for monitoring and debugging
- **Fallback History**: Track when and why fallback mechanisms were triggered

### Pipeline Triggering Mechanism

#### Service Availability Checking
```python
async def _validate_service_availability(
    service_router: ServiceRouter, 
    correlation_id: UUID
) -> None:
    """Validate service availability before job creation"""
    
    # Check service health
    health_status = await service_router.get_health_status()
    
    # Validate required services are available
    required_services = ['llamaparse', 'openai']
    for service in required_services:
        if not health_status[service]['healthy']:
            logger.warning(
                f"Service {service} unhealthy, will use fallback",
                correlation_id=str(correlation_id),
                service=service,
                health_status=health_status[service]
            )
    
    # Store health status for monitoring
    return health_status
```

#### Cost-Aware Job Scheduling
```python
async def _validate_cost_limits(
    request: UploadRequest, 
    correlation_id: UUID
) -> None:
    """Validate cost limits before job creation"""
    
    cost_tracker = get_cost_tracker()
    
    # Estimate processing costs
    estimated_cost = await _estimate_processing_cost(request)
    
    # Check daily and hourly limits
    if not await cost_tracker.check_daily_limit(estimated_cost):
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_429_TOO_MANY_REQUESTS,
            detail="Daily cost limit exceeded"
        )
    
    if not await cost_tracker.check_hourly_limit(estimated_cost):
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_429_TOO_MANY_REQUESTS,
            detail="Hourly cost limit exceeded"
        )
    
    logger.info(
        "Cost validation passed",
        correlation_id=str(correlation_id),
        estimated_cost=estimated_cost
    )
```

### Upload Validation Framework

#### Document Validation
- **Format Validation**: PDF format validation with MIME type checking
- **Size Validation**: File size limits with real service constraints
- **Content Validation**: Content hash validation and duplicate detection
- **Security Validation**: Filename sanitization and security checks

#### Service-Specific Validation
```python
async def _validate_real_service_requirements(
    request: UploadRequest,
    service_mode: ServiceMode
) -> None:
    """Validate requirements for real service processing"""
    
    if service_mode == ServiceMode.REAL:
        # Additional validation for real services
        if request.bytes_len > MAX_REAL_SERVICE_FILE_SIZE:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=status.HTTP_413_REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE,
                detail="File too large for real service processing"
            )
        
        # Validate API key availability
        if not _validate_api_keys_available():
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=status.HTTP_503_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE,
                detail="Real service API keys not available"
            )
```
