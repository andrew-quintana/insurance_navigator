## Technical Achievements

### 1. Service Router Architecture
The service router pattern represents a significant architectural innovation, enabling seamless switching between service modes:

```python
class ServiceRouter:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.services = self._initialize_services()
        self.health_checker = HealthChecker()
        self.cost_tracker = CostTracker()
    
    def get_service(self, service_type: str, mode: ServiceMode) -> ServiceClient:
        if mode == ServiceMode.MOCK:
            return self.services[service_type].mock
        elif mode == ServiceMode.REAL:
            return self._get_real_service(service_type)
        else:  # HYBRID
            return self._get_hybrid_service(service_type)
```

**Key Benefits**:
