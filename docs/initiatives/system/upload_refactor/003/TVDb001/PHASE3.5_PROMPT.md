# Phase 3.5 Execution Prompt: Job State Integration and End-to-End Testing

## Context
You are implementing Phase 3.5 of TVDb001 Real API Integration Testing. This phase implements job state integration and end-to-end webhook flow testing, building upon the completed webhook endpoint implementation from Phase 3.

## Documentation References
Please review these documents before starting implementation:
- **PRIMARY REFERENCE**: `TODOTVDb001.md` - Phase 3.5 section with complete implementation checklist
- `TODOTVDb001_phase3_notes.md` - Phase 3 implementation details and webhook architecture
- `TODOTVDb001_phase3_handoff.md` - Phase 3.5 requirements and integration points
- `TODOTVDb001_phase3_decisions.md` - Technical decisions and architecture patterns
- `TODOTVDb001_phase3_testing_summary.md` - Testing framework and validation approach
- `docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/CONTEXT003.md` - 003 job state management patterns
- `backend/api/routes/webhooks.py` - Existing webhook implementation with TODO items

## Primary Objective
**IMPLEMENT** job state integration and end-to-end webhook flow testing as specified in the Phase 3.5 section of TODOTVDb001.md. All implementation requirements, technical specifications, and detailed checklists are defined in the referenced documents.

## Expected Outputs
Document your work in these files:
- `TODOTVDb001_phase3.5_notes.md` - Job state integration implementation details
- `TODOTVDb001_phase3.5_decisions.md` - Integration decisions and technical trade-offs
- `TODOTVDb001_phase3.5_handoff.md` - Phase 4 requirements and deployment readiness
- `TODOTVDb001_phase3.5_testing_summary.md` - End-to-end testing results and validation

## Implementation Approach
1. **Read TODOTVDb001.md Phase 3.5 section thoroughly** - Use as primary implementation guide
2. **Review Phase 3 outputs** - Understand webhook implementation and security features
3. **Follow the detailed checklist** - Complete all Phase 3.5 tasks and validation requirements
4. **Integrate with 003 patterns** - Use existing job state management and buffer operations
5. **Test with real LlamaParse API** - Validate end-to-end webhook flow (cost-controlled)

## Key Focus Areas
- **Job State Integration**: Implement TODO items in webhook handlers
- **Database Integration**: Connect webhooks to 003 job state management
- **Pipeline Integration**: Trigger next processing stages from webhook callbacks
- **End-to-End Testing**: Validate complete webhook flow with real API
- **003 Pattern Integration**: Ensure consistency with existing 003 architecture

## Success Criteria
- **Job State Updates**: Webhook callbacks successfully update job status
- **Database Integration**: Transaction integrity and error handling operational
- **Pipeline Triggering**: Next processing stages triggered correctly
- **End-to-End Validation**: Complete webhook flow tested with real API
- **003 Integration**: Seamless integration with existing 003 patterns

## Next Steps
1. **Review TODOTVDb001.md Phase 3.5 section** - Understand all requirements and tasks
2. **Implement job state integration** - Complete TODO items in webhook handlers
3. **Test end-to-end flow** - Validate with real LlamaParse API
4. **Document results** - Create comprehensive Phase 3.5 deliverables

## Conclusion
Phase 3.5 represents the critical integration phase connecting webhook callbacks to 003 job state management. This phase will ensure that webhook processing integrates seamlessly with the existing 003 infrastructure.

**Ready to Proceed**: Phase 3.5 can begin immediately with the established webhook implementation and clear integration objectives defined in TODOTVDb001.md.
