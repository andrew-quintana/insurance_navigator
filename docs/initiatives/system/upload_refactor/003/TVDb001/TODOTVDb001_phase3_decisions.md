# TVDb001 Phase 3: LlamaParse Real API Integration - Technical Decisions

## Overview
This document captures the key technical decisions made during Phase 3 implementation, including architecture choices, security implementations, and testing strategies.

## Implementation Decisions

### 1. Webhook Endpoint Architecture

#### Decision: Dedicated Webhook Router
**Choice**: Created a separate webhook router (`backend/api/routes/webhooks.py`) instead of integrating webhooks into existing upload routes.

**Rationale**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Webhooks are fundamentally different from upload operations (asynchronous vs synchronous)
- **Security Isolation**: Webhook endpoints have different security requirements and validation needs
- **Scalability**: Dedicated router allows independent scaling and monitoring of webhook processing
- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and test webhook-specific logic separately

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Adding webhook endpoints to existing upload router
- Creating a generic webhook handler for all services
- Using FastAPI background tasks for webhook processing

**Impact**: Positive - Cleaner architecture, better security isolation, easier testing

#### Decision: HMAC Signature Verification
**Choice**: Implemented HMAC-SHA256 signature verification for webhook authenticity.

**Rationale**:
- **Security**: Prevents webhook tampering, replay attacks, and unauthorized callbacks
- **Industry Standard**: HMAC is the standard approach for webhook security
- **Performance**: Efficient cryptographic verification with minimal overhead
- **Configurability**: Webhook secret can be managed independently of API keys

**Alternatives Considered**:
- JWT tokens for webhook authentication
- API key-based authentication
- No authentication (insecure)

**Impact**: High - Critical security feature, industry best practice compliance

#### Decision: Raw Payload Processing
**Choice**: Process raw request body bytes for signature verification instead of parsed JSON.

**Rationale**:
- **Security**: Prevents JSON injection attacks and ensures signature integrity
- **Accuracy**: Signature verification must be performed on the exact bytes received
- **Reliability**: Avoids potential JSON parsing issues affecting signature validation
- **Standards Compliance**: Follows webhook security best practices

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Parsing JSON first, then verifying signature on parsed data
- Using request headers for signature verification
- Accepting both raw and parsed payloads

**Impact**: High - Critical security feature, prevents tampering attacks

### 2. API Integration Strategy

except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error processing webhook: {e}", exc_info=True)
    raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Internal server error")
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Generic error messages for all failures
- Detailed error messages for all failures (security risk)
- Custom error response formats

**Impact**: High - Balances security with debugging capability

#### Decision: Header Validation
**Choice**: Strict validation of required security headers.

**Rationale**:
- **Security**: Ensures required security headers are present
- **Reliability**: Prevents processing of requests without proper authentication
- **Standards Compliance**: Follows webhook security best practices
- **Debugging**: Clear indication of missing security headers

**Implementation**:
```python
signature = request.headers.get("X-Webhook-Signature")
if not signature:
    logger.warning("Missing webhook signature header")
    raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Missing webhook signature")
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Optional header validation
- Multiple header formats
- Custom header naming

**Impact**: High - Critical security feature, prevents unauthorized access
