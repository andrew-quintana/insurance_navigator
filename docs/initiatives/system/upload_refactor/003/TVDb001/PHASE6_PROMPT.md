# Phase 6 Execution Prompt: End-to-End Pipeline Validation

## Session Setup
Run `/clear` to start fresh, then execute this phase.

## Required Reading
**IMPORTANT**: Read these documents completely before starting implementation:

1. `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TVDb001/TODOTVDb001_phase1-5_handoff.md` - All previous phase outputs
2. `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE.md` - 003 testing approach reference
3. `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/FINAL_VALIDATION_REPORT.md` - 003 validation methodology
4. `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TVDb001/TODOTVDb001.md` - Phase 6 section for detailed tasks

## Phase Objectives
Conduct comprehensive end-to-end validation of the complete real service pipeline:
- Complete document processing pipeline with real LlamaParse and OpenAI APIs
- Performance benchmarking against 003 mock service baseline
- Error handling and recovery validation under various failure scenarios
- Cost tracking accuracy and budget control effectiveness validation

## Key Implementation Requirements
- Test complete pipeline from upload through vector storage using real services
- Compare performance characteristics with 003 mock service baseline
- Validate error handling covers all documented failure modes
- Confirm cost tracking accuracy and budget enforcement effectiveness

## Success Criteria
- Complete pipeline processes documents end-to-end with real services successfully
- Performance characteristics are within acceptable variance of mock baseline
- Error scenarios are handled gracefully with appropriate recovery mechanisms
- Cost tracking prevents budget overruns and provides accurate usage reporting

## Expected Deliverables
Follow the Phase 6 checklist in TODOTVDb001.md exactly. Create these outputs:
- `TODOTVDb001_phase6_notes.md` - Implementation details and validation results
- `TODOTVDb001_phase6_performance_report.md` - Performance benchmarking results
- `TODOTVDb001_phase6_validation_report.md` - Comprehensive validation results
- `TODOTVDb001_phase6_handoff.md` - Requirements for Phase 7
- `TODOTVDb001_phase6_testing_summary.md` - Complete test results and coverage

## Implementation Approach
Use the detailed task breakdown in TODOTVDb001.md Phase 6 section. Focus on comprehensive validation that demonstrates the real service integration maintains the reliability and performance characteristics achieved in Upload Refactor 003.

Start by reviewing all previous phase outputs, then follow the Phase 6 checklist systematically.
