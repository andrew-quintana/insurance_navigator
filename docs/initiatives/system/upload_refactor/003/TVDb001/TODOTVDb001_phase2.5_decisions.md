# TVDb001 Phase 2.5 Architectural Decisions

## Overview
This document captures the key architectural decisions, trade-offs, and technical choices made during Phase 2.5 of the TVDb001 Real API Integration Testing project. These decisions form the foundation for the production-ready real service integration infrastructure.

## Core Architectural Decisions

### 1. Service Interface Abstraction

**Decision**: Implement all real services using the existing `ServiceInterface` abstraction from the service router.

**Rationale**:
- **Consistency**: Maintains consistency with Phase 1-2 mock service implementations
- **Interchangeability**: Enables seamless switching between mock and real services
- **Testing**: Simplifies testing by using the same interface for both mock and real implementations
- **Maintainability**: Single interface reduces code duplication and maintenance overhead

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Direct API Integration**: Implementing services directly without interface abstraction
- **New Interface Design**: Creating a new interface specifically for real services
- **Hybrid Approach**: Mix of interface-based and direct implementations

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Consistent architecture, easy testing, maintainable code
- **Cons**: Some real service complexity hidden behind interface abstraction
- **Decision**: Interface abstraction provides more benefits than drawbacks

**Implementation**: All real services implement `ServiceInterface` with `is_available()`, `get_health()`, and `execute()` methods.

### 2. Environment-Based Configuration

**Decision**: Use environment variables for all real service configuration, loaded from `.env.development` files.

**Rationale**:
- **Security**: API keys and sensitive configuration not hardcoded in source code
- **Flexibility**: Easy configuration changes without code modifications
