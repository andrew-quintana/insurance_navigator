# Phase 2 Execution Prompt: Upload Initiation & Flow Validation

## Session Setup
Run `/clear` to start fresh, then execute this phase.

## Required Reading
**IMPORTANT**: Read these documents completely before starting implementation:

1. `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TVDb001/TODOTVDb001_phase1_notes.md` - Phase 1 outputs
2. `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TVDb001/TODOTVDb001_phase1_handoff.md` - Phase 1 handoff requirements  
3. `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TVDb001/TODOTVDb001.md` - Phase 2 section for detailed tasks
4. `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/RFC003.md` - Original upload flow implementation
5. `@backend/api/routes/upload.py` - Existing upload endpoints from 003

## Phase Objectives
Validate and enhance the upload initiation flow for real service integration:
- Upload triggering with signed URL generation and document storage
- Pipeline triggering mechanism with service router integration
- Job creation and state management with correlation ID tracking
- Upload validation and testing across service modes

## Key Implementation Requirements
- Integrate with Phase 1 service router and cost tracking infrastructure
- Maintain compatibility with existing 003 upload flow
- Add correlation ID tracking throughout the upload pipeline
- Implement cost-aware job scheduling and processing

## Success Criteria
- Upload flow works seamlessly with all service modes (mock/real/hybrid)
- Job creation includes proper service mode tracking and correlation IDs
- Pipeline triggering integrates correctly with service router
- Cost tracking prevents budget overruns during upload processing

## Expected Deliverables
Follow the Phase 2 checklist in TODOTVDb001.md exactly. Create these outputs:
- `TODOTVDb001_phase2_notes.md` - Implementation details and decisions
- `TODOTVDb001_phase2_decisions.md` - Technical decisions and rationale
- `TODOTVDb001_phase2_handoff.md` - Requirements for Phase 3
- `TODOTVDb001_phase2_testing_summary.md` - Test results and coverage

## Implementation Approach
Use the detailed task breakdown in TODOTVDb001.md Phase 2 section. Focus on validating the upload triggering mechanism works correctly with the service router infrastructure from Phase 1.

Start by reviewing Phase 1 outputs, then follow the Phase 2 checklist systematically.
