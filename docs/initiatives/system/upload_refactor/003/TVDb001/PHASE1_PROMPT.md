# Phase 1 Execution Prompt: Environment Setup & Service Router

## Session Setup
Run `/clear` to start fresh, then execute this phase.

## Required Reading
**IMPORTANT**: Read these documents completely before starting implementation:

1. `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TVDb001/CONTEXT001.md` - Project context and scope
2. `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TVDb001/PRDTVDb001.md` - Business requirements and success criteria
3. `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TVDb001/RFCTVDb001.md` - Technical architecture (focus on sections 1-4)
4. `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TVDb001/TODOTVDb001.md` - Phase 1 section for detailed tasks
5. `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/CONTEXT003.md` - Foundation context from 003

## Phase Objectives
Implement the foundation infrastructure for real service integration:
- Service router with real/mock/hybrid mode switching
- Cost tracking system with daily budget limits 
- Enhanced configuration management for API credentials
- Exception classes for comprehensive error handling

## Key Implementation Requirements
- Maintain backward compatibility with 003 Docker environment
- Implement cost controls to prevent API budget overruns
- Ensure seamless service switching for development workflow
- Create proper abstraction layers for service integration

## Success Criteria
- Service router successfully switches between service modes
- Cost tracking accurately monitors and enforces budget limits
- Configuration management handles API credentials securely
- All unit tests pass with comprehensive error scenario coverage

## Expected Deliverables
Follow the Phase 1 checklist in TODOTVDb001.md exactly. Create these outputs:
- `TODOTVDb001_phase1_notes.md` - Implementation details and decisions
- `TODOTVDb001_phase1_decisions.md` - Technical decisions and rationale
- `TODOTVDb001_phase1_handoff.md` - Requirements for Phase 2
- `TODOTVDb001_phase1_testing_summary.md` - Test results and coverage

## Implementation Approach
Use the detailed task breakdown in TODOTVDb001.md Phase 1 section. Focus on creating robust, tested infrastructure that Phase 2 can build upon.

Start by thoroughly reading the required documents, then follow the Phase 1 checklist systematically.
