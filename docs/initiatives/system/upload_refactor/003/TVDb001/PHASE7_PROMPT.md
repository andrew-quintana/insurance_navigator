# Phase 7 Execution Prompt: Monitoring & Cost Control Enhancement

## Session Setup
Run `/clear` to start fresh, then execute this phase.

## Required Reading
**IMPORTANT**: Read these documents completely before starting implementation:

1. `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TVDb001/TODOTVDb001_phase6_validation_report.md` - Phase 6 validation results
2. `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TVDb001/TODOTVDb001_phase6_handoff.md` - Phase 6 handoff requirements
3. `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE.md` - 003 monitoring approach
4. `@docs/initiatives/system/upload_refactor/003/TVDb001/TODOTVDb001.md` - Phase 7 section for detailed tasks
5. Existing monitoring dashboard code from 003

## Phase Objectives
Enhance monitoring and cost control systems based on validation results:
- Enhanced monitoring dashboard with real service metrics and cost tracking
- Advanced alerting for cost limits and service availability
- Usage analytics and optimization recommendations
- Operational procedures for real service management

## Key Implementation Requirements
- Build upon Phase 6 validation results to identify monitoring requirements
- Enhance existing 003 monitoring infrastructure with real service capabilities
- Implement cost threshold alerts and usage analytics
- Create operational procedures for real service management and optimization

## Success Criteria
- Enhanced dashboard provides comprehensive visibility into real service behavior
- Alerting system promptly notifies of cost limits and service availability issues
- Usage analytics provide actionable insights for cost optimization
- Operational procedures enable effective real service management

## Expected Deliverables
Follow the Phase 7 checklist in TODOTVDb001.md exactly. Create these outputs:
- `TODOTVDb001_phase7_notes.md` - Implementation details and monitoring enhancements
- `TODOTVDb001_phase7_monitoring_guide.md` - Monitoring system documentation
- `TODOTVDb001_phase7_operations_manual.md` - Operational procedures and runbooks
- `TODOTVDb001_phase7_handoff.md` - Requirements for Phase 8
- `TODOTVDb001_phase7_testing_summary.md` - Monitoring and alerting test results

## Implementation Approach
Use the detailed task breakdown in TODOTVDb001.md Phase 7 section. Focus on creating production-ready monitoring and cost control systems that provide operational visibility and management capabilities for real service integration.

Start by reviewing Phase 6 validation results, then follow the Phase 7 checklist systematically.
