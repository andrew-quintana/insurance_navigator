## Phase 4 Requirements

### 1. Pipeline Integration

#### 1.1 Next Processing Stage Triggering
**Priority**: High
**Description**: Implement the logic to trigger the next processing stages after successful parsing.

**Requirements**:
- Connect webhook callbacks to the next processing stages in the pipeline
- Implement job progression from `parsed` status to `chunking` or `embedding_queued`
- Ensure proper state transitions follow the 003 state machine
- Add correlation ID tracking through all stages

**Implementation Points**:
```python
# In _handle_parsed_status function, replace TODO with:
# TODO: Trigger next processing stage
logger.info(f"Triggering next processing stage for {correlation_id}")

# Options:
# 1. Direct function calls to next stage processors
# 2. Message queue publishing for async processing
# 3. Event-driven architecture with event listeners
```

**Files to Modify**:
- `backend/api/routes/webhooks.py` - `_handle_parsed_status` function
- `backend/workers/base_worker.py` - Add pipeline progression logic
- `backend/shared/services/` - Consider adding pipeline orchestration service

#### 1.2 Job Progression Logic
**Priority**: High
**Description**: Implement the state machine logic for advancing jobs through the pipeline.

**Requirements**:
- Define clear state transitions: `parsed` â†’ `chunking` â†’ `chunks_stored` â†’ `embedding_queued`
- Implement state validation and transition rules
- Add rollback capabilities for failed transitions
- Ensure idempotency of state transitions

**State Machine Definition**:
```
uploaded â†’ parse_queued â†’ parsed â†’ chunking â†’ chunks_stored â†’ embedding_queued â†’ 
embedding_in_progress â†’ embeddings_stored â†’ complete

Failed states: failed_parse, failed_chunking, failed_embedding
```

**Implementation Points**:
```python
# Consider adding to base_worker.py or new pipeline_service.py:
class PipelineStateManager:
    async def advance_job_state(self, job_id: UUID, target_state: str, correlation_id: str):
        """Advance job to next state with validation and rollback."""
        pass
    
    async def validate_state_transition(self, current_state: str, target_state: str) -> bool:
        """Validate if state transition is allowed."""
        pass
```

#### 1.3 Retry Mechanisms
**Priority**: Medium
**Description**: Implement retry logic for failed operations with exponential backoff.

**Requirements**:
- Implement exponential backoff for transient failures
- Add circuit breaker pattern for persistent failures
- Configure retry limits and timeouts
- Log retry attempts and failures for monitoring

**Implementation Points**:
```python
# In _handle_failed_status function, replace TODO with:
# TODO: Implement retry logic if appropriate
logger.info(f"Implementing retry logic for {correlation_id}")

# Consider adding retry service:
class RetryService:
    async def should_retry(self, job_id: UUID, error_type: str, attempt_count: int) -> bool:
        """Determine if operation should be retried."""
        pass
    
    async def schedule_retry(self, job_id: UUID, delay_seconds: int):
        """Schedule retry with exponential backoff."""
        pass
```

**Implementation Points**:
```python
# Extend cost_tracker.py for real API testing:
class RealAPICostTracker:
    async def track_api_usage(self, service: str, operation: str, cost: float):
        """Track real API costs for testing."""
        pass
    
    async def check_budget_limits(self, service: str) -> bool:
        """Check if API usage is within budget limits."""
        pass
    
    async def get_usage_summary(self, service: str) -> dict:
        """Get current usage and cost summary."""
        pass
```

#### 2.2 End-to-End Real API Testing
**Priority**: High

- Manage API timeouts and network failures
- Handle malformed webhook payloads
- Test webhook retry scenarios

**Implementation Points**:
```python
# Add to webhook handlers:
async def _handle_api_rate_limit(self, correlation_id: str):
    """Handle LlamaParse API rate limiting."""
    pass

async def _handle_api_timeout(self, correlation_id: str):
    """Handle LlamaParse API timeouts."""
    pass

async def _handle_malformed_payload(self, correlation_id: str, payload: bytes):
