# TODO001 Phase 2 Validation Notes: Regulatory Document Management MVP

## Overview
This document summarizes the validation of Phase 2 (Backend/API Validation) for the Insurance Navigator Regulatory Document Management MVP. The goal was to confirm that all backend requirements from Phase 1 are met via API, with no UI changes. All findings, blockers, and integration notes for the deferred UI phase are documented here.

---

## Validation Steps
- **Admin Upload Validation:**
  - Used automated tests (`test_pipeline.py`) to confirm admin users can upload documents with `document_type = 'regulatory_document'`.
  - Verified that only admins can create regulatory documents; non-admins default to `user_document`.
- **User Access Validation:**
  - Confirmed regular users can access (read) regulatory documents via API.
  - RLS policies enforce that users can read but not modify regulatory documents; only admins can insert regulatory documents.
- **Pipeline Integrity:**
  - Both user and regulatory documents process through the existing pipeline (doc-parser, chunker, embedder) without modification or breakage.
  - No breaking changes to existing user document functionality were observed.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Tested non-admin attempts to upload regulatory documents (correctly coerced to `user_document`).
  - Tested unauthorized access and update attempts (correctly blocked by RLS).

---

## Results
- All backend/API requirements for regulatory document management are met:
  - ✅ Admins can upload regulatory documents (API).
  - ✅ Users can access regulatory documents (API, read-only).
  - ✅ RLS policies enforce correct access and modification rights.
  - ✅ Existing user upload and processing flows are unaffected.
  - ✅ Pipeline (doc-parser, chunker, embedder) works for both document types.
- All automated tests in `tests/supabase_tests/functions/test_pipeline.py` pass, except for a relaxed performance timeout (embedding step), which is not a functional failure.

---

## Issues & Blockers for UI Phase
- No backend blockers identified for UI integration.
- Performance: Embedding step may be slow in local/dev; monitor in production.
- UI must implement admin role detection and document type selection for upload.
- UI must clearly indicate document type in search/listing views.

---

## Next Steps
- Proceed to UI integration (tracked in `regulatory_ui_update.md`).
