# TODO001: Insurance Document Ingestion Pipeline Implementation

## Context & Overview

This TODO builds upon **PRD001.md** and **RFC001.md** to provide detailed implementation tasks for the insurance document ingestion pipeline refactor. The implementation is organized into discrete phases designed for execution in separate Claude Code sessions.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Replace legacy systems in `supabase/functions/` and `db/services/`
- Implement job-queue-based pipeline: upload → parse → chunk → embed → finalize
- Achieve 95% processing success rate with idempotent resume capability
- Deploy production-ready FastAPI workers and database schema

**Technical Approach:**
- Postgres-based job queue with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
- Co-located embeddings with buffer-based atomic updates
- Deterministic UUID generation for perfect idempotency
- Comprehensive observability and error handling

## Notes

**Implementation Strategy:**
This TODO is designed for execution across 5 separate Claude Code sessions, with each phase building on documented outputs from previous phases. Each phase is self-contained and can be executed independently by reading the specified prerequisite files.

**Session Management:**
- Always run `/clear` before starting a new phase
- Each phase includes complete context for a fresh Claude session
- Save all specified output files for continuity between phases
- Reference previous phase outputs using `@filename.md` syntax

**Quality Assurance:**
- Each phase includes comprehensive testing requirements
- Validation checklists ensure nothing is missed
- Documentation requirements maintain project continuity
- Final validation confirms all PRD/RFC requirements are met

**Flexibility:**
If any phase becomes too complex, it can be further subdivided using the same pattern (e.g., Phase 3A, 3B, 3C) while maintaining the session-based approach and documentation continuity.
