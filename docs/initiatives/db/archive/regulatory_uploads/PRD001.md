# PRD001: Admin Regulatory Document Management System

## Document Context
- **Version**: PRD001.md
- **Created**: 2025-01-24
- **Project**: Insurance Navigator Platform - Admin Document Management Extension
- **Next Document**: RFC001_admin_regulatory_documents.md

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the requirements for extending the Insurance Navigator platform with administrative capabilities to upload, manage, and provide access to regulatory documents. The system will enable administrators to build a centralized repository of insurance regulatory documents while maintaining the existing user document upload pipeline.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- Users can upload and process their personal insurance documents through a sophisticated pipeline (upload → parse → chunk → embed)
- No administrative interface exists for managing regulatory documents
- No way to provide users access to relevant regulatory information alongside their personal documents
- Regulatory compliance research requires manual external searches

**Pain Points:**
1. **Administrators** cannot efficiently populate the system with regulatory documents for user reference
2. **Users** lack access to relevant regulatory context when reviewing their personal documents
3. **Support teams** cannot easily reference official regulatory documents when assisting users
4. **Compliance teams** have no centralized system for regulatory document management

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Upload Efficiency**: Reduce regulatory document upload time from manual research (hours) to direct upload (minutes)
- **Document Accessibility**: 95% of users can find relevant regulatory documents within 3 search attempts
- **Admin Productivity**: Administrators can upload and categorize 50+ regulatory documents per hour
- **System Integration**: 100% compatibility with existing user document processing pipeline

### Secondary Metrics
- **Search Success Rate**: 85% of regulatory document searches return relevant results
- **Document Utilization**: Track which regulatory documents are most frequently accessed
- **Processing Reliability**: 99.5% successful processing rate for admin-uploaded documents
- **User Satisfaction**: User feedback scores improve by 20% when regulatory context is available

## User Stories

### Admin User Stories
**As an Administrator, I want to:**
1. Upload regulatory documents so that users have access to relevant compliance information
2. Categorize documents by regulation type (state, federal, industry-specific) for organized access
3. Search and download any document in the system for compliance verification
4. Bulk upload multiple regulatory documents to efficiently build the repository
5. View processing status of uploaded documents to ensure successful integration

### End User Stories
**As an Insurance User, I want to:**
1. Access relevant regulatory documents related to my uploaded policies
2. Search regulatory documents by category or keyword to understand compliance requirements
3. View regulatory context alongside my personal documents for better understanding

### Support Team Stories
**As a Support Representative, I want to:**
1. Access all documents (user and regulatory) to provide comprehensive assistance
2. Reference official regulatory documents when explaining policy details to users

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality

#### FR1: Admin Document Upload
- **FR1.1**: Admin users can upload regulatory documents through dedicated admin interface
- **FR1.2**: Documents are automatically processed through existing pipeline (parse → chunk → embed)
- **FR1.3**: Admin uploads are tagged with `document_type = 'regulatory_document'`
- **FR1.4**: Support for standard document formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, MD)

#### FR2: Document Categorization
- **FR2.1**: Admin can assign categories during upload (federal, state, industry-specific)
- **FR2.2**: Admin can add descriptive metadata (title, description, relevant regulations)
- **FR2.3**: Documents inherit processing status tracking from existing system

#### FR3: Admin Document Management
- **FR3.1**: Admin can search across all documents (user and regulatory)
- **FR3.2**: Admin can download any document from the system
- **FR3.3**: Admin can view document processing status and troubleshoot failures
- **FR3.4**: Admin can update document metadata and categories

#### FR4: User Access to Regulatory Documents
- **FR4.1**: Users can search regulatory documents separately from their personal documents
- **FR4.2**: Regulatory documents appear in semantic search results when relevant
- **FR4.3**: Users can view but not modify regulatory documents

#### FR5: Document Type Differentiation
- **FR5.1**: System clearly distinguishes between user documents and regulatory documents
- **FR5.2**: Different access permissions apply based on document type
- **FR5.3**: Processing pipeline handles both document types identically

### Integration Requirements

#### FR6: Existing Pipeline Compatibility
- **FR6.1**: Regulatory documents use same processing functions (doc-parser, chunker, embedder)
- **FR6.2**: Vector embeddings enable semantic search across both document types
- **FR6.3**: No modifications required to core processing edge functions

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- **NFR1**: Admin document uploads complete within 30 seconds for files up to 50MB
- **NFR2**: Search across regulatory documents returns results within 3 seconds
- **NFR3**: Bulk uploads support up to 10 concurrent documents without performance degradation

### Security Requirements
- **NFR4**: Only authenticated admin users can upload regulatory documents
- **NFR5**: Regular users cannot modify or delete regulatory documents
- **NFR6**: All document access follows Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- **NFR7**: Admin actions are logged for audit compliance

### Scalability Requirements
- **NFR8**: System supports storage of 10,000+ regulatory documents
- **NFR9**: Search performance remains consistent with document repository growth
- **NFR10**: Processing pipeline handles increased document volume without bottlenecks

### Usability Requirements
- **NFR11**: Admin interface follows existing design patterns and UI components
- **NFR12**: Document categorization uses intuitive dropdown/tagging interface
- **NFR13**: Processing status provides clear feedback and error messaging

## Acceptance Criteria

- **D7**: Supabase storage and edge function quotas accommodate increased usage

## Out of Scope

### Phase 1 Exclusions
- Advanced workflow management (approval processes, document versions)
- Automated regulatory document discovery or web scraping
- Integration with external regulatory databases
- Real-time collaborative document editing
- Advanced analytics and reporting dashboard

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **R1**: Database migration could temporarily impact existing user uploads
