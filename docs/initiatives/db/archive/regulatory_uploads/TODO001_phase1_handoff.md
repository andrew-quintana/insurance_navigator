# TODO001 Phase 1 Handoff & Integration Notes

## Overview
This document provides a handoff summary for Phase 1 (Core Backend) of the Insurance Navigator Regulatory Document Management MVP. It outlines what is ready, integration points for the frontend, and any blockers or recommendations for Phase 2.

---

## Whatâ€™s Ready (Backend)
- **Database:**
  - `documents.documents` table now supports `document_type` (user/regulatory).
  - RLS policies enforce correct access for both document types.
- **API/Edge Functions:**
  - Upload handler supports admin upload of regulatory documents.
  - Regulatory documents are stored in `regulatory/{user_id}/raw/...`.
  - User documents remain in `user/{user_id}/raw/...`.
- **Testing:**
  - Automated tests validate all backend requirements and access controls.

---

## Integration Points for Phase 2 (Frontend)
- **Admin Upload UI:**
  - Add a document type selector (default: user_document, allow regulatory_document for admins).
  - Pass `documentType` in form data to the upload handler.
  - Show upload success/failure based on API response.
- **User Access UI:**
  - Update document search/listing to include `regulatory_document` type for all users.
  - Display document type indicator in search results.
  - Allow users to view (read-only) regulatory documents.
- **Role Detection:**
  - Frontend should detect admin role (from JWT or user profile) to enable regulatory upload option.

---

## Blockers & Gotchas
- **No UI Changes Yet:** Phase 1 is backend only; frontend must be updated to expose new functionality.
- **Performance:** Embedding step may be slow in local/dev; production performance should be monitored.
- **Schema Awareness:** Frontend queries must target the correct schema/table if using direct REST or client libraries.
- **Testing:** Ensure frontend tests cover both user and admin flows for regulatory documents.

---

## Recommendations for Phase 2
- Leverage existing upload/search UI components; avoid building new ones from scratch.
- Use the new `document_type` field to filter and display documents appropriately.
- Ensure admin-only UI for regulatory document upload.
- Add clear indicators for document type in all relevant UI.
- Validate end-to-end flows (admin upload, user search/view) before sign-off.

## Status
