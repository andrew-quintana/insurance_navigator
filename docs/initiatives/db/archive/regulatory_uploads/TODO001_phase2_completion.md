# TODO001 Phase 2 Completion Summary: Regulatory Document Management MVP

## Overview
This document summarizes the completion of Phase 2 (Backend/API Validation) for the Insurance Navigator Regulatory Document Management MVP. All backend requirements have been validated via API, and the system is ready for UI integration.

---

## Validation Results
- All backend/API requirements for regulatory document management are met (see `TODO001_phase2_notes.md`):
  - Admin users can upload documents with `regulatory_document` type (API).
  - Regular user uploads continue unchanged as `user_document` type.
  - Documents process through the existing pipeline (doc-parser, chunker, embedder) without modifications.
  - RLS policies enforce proper access (users read regulatory, admins insert regulatory).
  - No breaking changes to existing functionality.
  - All findings and blockers are documented.

---

## Success Criteria (from `TODO001.md`)
- [x] Admin users can upload documents with `regulatory_document` type (API)
- [x] Regular user uploads continue unchanged as `user_document` type
- [x] Documents process through the existing pipeline without modifications
- [x] RLS policies enforce proper access (users read regulatory, admins insert regulatory)
- [x] No breaking changes to existing functionality
- [x] All findings and blockers are documented

---

## Issues & Blockers
- No backend blockers identified for UI integration.
- Performance: Embedding step may be slow in local/dev; monitor in production.

---

## Next Steps
- Proceed to UI integration (tracked in `regulatory_ui_update.md`).
- All UI-related tasks are deferred and tracked separately.
