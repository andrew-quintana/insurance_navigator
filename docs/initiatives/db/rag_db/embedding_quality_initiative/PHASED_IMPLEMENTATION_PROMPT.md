- Performance concerns: Performance team consultation

**Escalation Path:**
1. Phase validation failure â†’ Technical lead review
2. Performance impact concerns â†’ Architecture review
3. Production readiness concerns â†’ Engineering manager approval

**Resources:**
- Existing codebase patterns in `backend/shared/`
- Error handling framework in `backend/shared/external/error_handler.py`
