# Product Requirements Document: Threading Update Initiative

## Document Information

- **Title**: Threading Update Initiative
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2025-10-10
- **Status**: Draft
- **Owner**: Development Team
- **Stakeholders**: Technical Architecture Team, Operations Team

## Executive Summary

The Threading Update Initiative addresses critical system reliability issues caused by complex threading logic in the RAG system. The current implementation causes complete system hangs under concurrent load, preventing the system from serving multiple users simultaneously.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
The RAG system uses complex manual threading with queues and timeouts, leading to:
- **System Hangs**: Complete failure with 5+ concurrent requests
- **Resource Contention**: Multiple threads competing for HTTP connections
- **Poor Scalability**: Cannot handle multiple users simultaneously
- **Unreliable Performance**: Unpredictable behavior under load

### Business Impact
- **User Experience**: Requests timeout after 60 seconds
- **System Reliability**: Complete failure under normal load
- **Scalability**: Cannot support multiple concurrent users
- **Operational Overhead**: Manual intervention required for failures

## User Stories

### Story 1: Concurrent User Support
**As a** user of the insurance navigator
**I want** the system to handle multiple users simultaneously
**So that** I don't experience timeouts or failures

### Story 2: Reliable Performance
**As a** user of the insurance navigator
**I want** consistent response times
**So that** I can rely on the system for my insurance needs

### Story 3: System Stability
**As an** operations team member
**I want** the system to be stable under load
**So that** I don't need to manually intervene during failures

## Success Metrics
