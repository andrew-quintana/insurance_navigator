# Threading Update Initiative - MVP Product Requirements Document

## Document Information

- **Title**: Threading Update Initiative - MVP
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2025-10-10
- **Status**: Draft
- **Owner**: Development Team
- **Stakeholders**: Technical Architecture Team, Operations Team

## Executive Summary

This MVP initiative addresses the critical hanging issue in the RAG system with a minimal, focused approach. The goal is to get the system working reliably under concurrent load without over-engineering the solution.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issue
The RAG system's `_generate_embedding()` method in `agents/tooling/rag/core.py` causes:
- **Hanging failures** with 5+ concurrent requests
- **60+ second timeouts** 
- **Resource contention** and deadlocks
- **Poor user experience** under load

### Business Impact
- **User Experience**: Requests timeout after 60 seconds
- **System Reliability**: Complete failure under normal load
- **Scalability**: Cannot support multiple concurrent users
- **Operational Overhead**: Manual intervention required for failures

## MVP Solution

**Simple async/await conversion** - Replace the complex threading logic with basic async patterns:
- Convert `_generate_embedding()` to async method
- Use `httpx.AsyncClient` for HTTP requests  
- Remove threading and queue management
- Keep existing interfaces unchanged

## MVP Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR1: Minimal Async Conversion
- **Requirement**: Convert threading to async/await
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - `_generate_embedding()` method is async
  - No manual thread management
  - Uses `httpx.AsyncClient`
  - Existing interfaces preserved

#### FR2: Concurrent Request Handling
- **Requirement**: Handle concurrent requests without hanging
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - No hanging with 5+ concurrent requests
  - Response times under 10 seconds
  - System remains stable under load

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR1: Performance
- **Requirement**: Fix hanging issue with minimal performance impact
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - No hanging with 5+ concurrent requests
  - Response times under 10 seconds
  - Existing functionality preserved

#### NFR2: Reliability
- **Requirement**: Eliminate hanging failures
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Handle 5+ concurrent requests
  - No system hangs
  - Proper error handling

#### NFR3: Maintainability
- **Requirement**: Simplify codebase
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Reduced complexity
  - Better error handling
  - Easier debugging

## MVP Scope

### What We're Doing (MVP)
- ✅ Fix the hanging issue with minimal changes
- ✅ Convert threading to async/await
- ✅ Test with concurrent requests
- ✅ Deploy to production

### What We're NOT Doing (Out of Scope)
- ❌ Complex architecture redesign
- ❌ Extensive connection pooling optimization
- ❌ Advanced circuit breaker patterns
- ❌ Comprehensive monitoring overhaul
- ❌ Performance optimization beyond fixing hangs

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Concurrent Request Handling**: 5+ requests without hanging
- **Response Time**: <10 seconds for all requests
- **Success Rate**: >99% request success rate
- **System Stability**: No hanging failures

### Secondary Metrics
- **Memory Usage**: Stable memory consumption
- **Error Rate**: <1% error rate
- **Code Complexity**: Reduced complexity metrics

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Minimal Async Conversion
- Convert `_generate_embedding()` to async
- Replace threading with `httpx.AsyncClient`
- Remove queue and thread management code
- Test basic functionality

### Step 2: Concurrent Testing
- Test with 2-3 concurrent requests
- Test with 5+ concurrent requests (hanging scenario)
- Verify no timeouts or hangs
- Measure response times

### Step 3: Production Deployment
- Deploy MVP fix to production
- Monitor for hanging issues
- Validate concurrent request handling
- Confirm fix effectiveness

## Timeline

- **Step 1**: 1-2 hours (Async conversion)
- **Step 2**: 1 hour (Testing)
- **Step 3**: 1 hour (Deployment)

**Total Estimated Duration**: 3-4 hours

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Performance Regression
- **Risk**: New implementation may be slower
- **Mitigation**: Basic performance testing, rollback plan

### Risk 2: Compatibility Issues
- **Risk**: Changes may break existing functionality
- **Mitigation**: Thorough testing, backward compatibility checks

### Risk 3: Deployment Issues
- **Risk**: Production deployment may fail
- **Mitigation**: Staged deployment, rollback plan, monitoring
