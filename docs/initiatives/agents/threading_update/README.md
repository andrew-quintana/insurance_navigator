# Threading Update Initiative

## Overview

This initiative addresses critical threading issues in the RAG system that cause hanging failures under concurrent load. The current implementation uses complex manual thread management with queues and timeouts, leading to resource contention and deadlocks when multiple requests are processed simultaneously.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issue
- **Hanging Failure**: System hangs completely with 5+ concurrent requests
- **Resource Contention**: Multiple threads competing for HTTP connections and resources
- **Thread Pool Exhaustion**: No limits on concurrent threads or connection pooling
- **Complex Threading Logic**: Manual thread management with queue-based communication

### Impact
- **Production Failure**: Complete system failure under concurrent load
- **User Experience**: Requests timeout after 60 seconds
- **Scalability**: System cannot handle multiple users simultaneously
- **Reliability**: Unpredictable behavior under load

## Initiative Phases

### Phase 1: Scope Update & Research (Current)
- [ ] Research async/await best practices
- [ ] Analyze current threading implementation
- [ ] Document findings in RFC
- [ ] Define implementation approach

### Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Replace threading logic with async/await
- [ ] Add connection pooling
- [ ] Implement concurrency limits
- [ ] Update RAG system architecture

### Phase 3: Local Validation
- [ ] Test in development environment
- [ ] Validate concurrent request handling
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Load testing

### Phase 4: Production Deployment
- [ ] Commit and push changes
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor performance
- [ ] Validate fix effectiveness

## Success Criteria

- ✅ System handles 10+ concurrent requests without hanging
- ✅ Response times remain under 30 seconds under load
- ✅ No resource exhaustion or deadlocks
- ✅ Improved scalability and reliability
