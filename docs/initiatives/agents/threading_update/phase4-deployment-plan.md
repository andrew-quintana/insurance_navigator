# Threading Update Initiative - Deployment Plan

## Phase 4: Production Deployment

### Overview
Deploy the async threading fix to production and validate that it resolves the hanging issues.

### Deployment Strategy

#### 1. Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Code review and approval
- [ ] Final testing in development
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Rollback plan preparation

#### 2. Deployment
- [ ] Commit and push changes
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor deployment health
- [ ] Verify service startup

#### 3. Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor system performance
- [ ] Test concurrent requests
- [ ] Validate fix effectiveness
- [ ] Document results

### Deployment Steps

#### Step 1: Code Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -S -m "feat: replace threading with async/await in RAG system

- Replace complex threading logic with async/await
- Add connection pooling for HTTP requests
- Implement concurrency limits
- Fix hanging issues with concurrent requests

Fixes: Threading deadlock in RAG system
Resolves: FM-038 hanging failure investigation"
git push origin feature/threading-update-initiative
```

#### Step 2: Production Deployment
- **Method**: Standard deployment process
- **Environment**: Production
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring
- **Rollback**: Available if needed

#### Step 3: Validation Testing
- **Concurrent Requests**: Test with 5+ requests
- **Performance**: Monitor response times
- **Stability**: Check for hanging issues
- **Metrics**: Compare with baseline

### Monitoring Plan

#### Key Metrics
- **Response Times**: Should remain <30 seconds
- **Success Rate**: Should be >99%
- **Concurrent Handling**: Should handle 10+ requests
- **Memory Usage**: Should be stable
- **Error Rates**: Should be <1%

#### Alerts
- **Hanging Detection**: Alert if requests timeout
- **Performance Degradation**: Alert if response times increase
- **Error Rate Increase**: Alert if errors spike
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Alert if memory/CPU spikes

### Rollback Plan

#### Rollback Triggers
- **Hanging Issues**: If hanging returns
- **Performance Degradation**: If response times increase significantly
- **Error Rate Increase**: If error rates spike
- **System Instability**: If system becomes unstable

#### Rollback Process
1. **Immediate**: Revert to previous version
2. **Investigation**: Analyze root cause
3. **Fix**: Address issues
4. **Re-deploy**: Deploy corrected version

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Deployment successful
- [ ] No hanging with concurrent requests
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved
- [ ] Error rates stable
- [ ] System stability confirmed

### Timeline

- **Day 1**: Deployment and initial validation
- **Total**: 1 day

### Post-Deployment Tasks

- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours
- [ ] Document results
- [ ] Update runbooks
- [ ] Close related issues
- [ ] Celebrate success! ðŸŽ‰
