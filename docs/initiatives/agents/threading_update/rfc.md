# RFC: Threading Update for RAG System

## Status: DRAFT (Phase 1 - Research In Progress)

> **Note**: This RFC is currently in Phase 1 research phase. The content will be completed after research and analysis.

## Summary

This RFC proposes replacing the complex threading logic in the RAG system with a simpler async/await approach to resolve hanging failures under concurrent load.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues
- **Hanging Failure**: System hangs completely with 5+ concurrent requests
- **Resource Contention**: Multiple threads competing for HTTP connections
- **Thread Pool Exhaustion**: No limits on concurrent threads
- **Complex Threading Logic**: Manual thread management with queues

### Impact
- **Production Failure**: Complete system failure under concurrent load
- **User Experience**: Requests timeout after 60 seconds
- **Scalability**: System cannot handle multiple users simultaneously

## Proposed Solution

> **To be completed in Phase 1 research**

## Implementation Plan

> **To be completed in Phase 1 research**

## Risks and Mitigation

> **To be completed in Phase 1 research**

## Success Criteria

> **To be completed in Phase 1 research**

## Timeline
