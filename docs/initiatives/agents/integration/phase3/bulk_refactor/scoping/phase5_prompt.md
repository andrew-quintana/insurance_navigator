# Phase 5: Testing & Deployment - LLM Implementation Prompt

## Context
You are implementing Phase 5 of the Agent Integration Infrastructure Refactor initiative. This phase focuses on comprehensive testing, performance validation, and production deployment of all previous phase implementations.

## Reference Documents
- **Primary Specification**: `@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/bulk_refactor/spec_refactor.md` - Review all "Acceptance Criteria" and "Deliverables" sections for complete validation requirements
- **Technical Design**: `@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/bulk_refactor/rfc.md` - Reference "Implementation Plan" Phase 5 section and "Monitoring & Metrics" for deployment strategy
- **Implementation Tasks**: `@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/bulk_refactor/todo.md` - Follow "Phase 5: Testing & Deployment" section for comprehensive testing and deployment procedures

## Key Implementation Areas
Refer to the RFC document sections for:
- Comprehensive integration testing covering all phases
- Performance benchmarking and validation
- Staging and production deployment procedures
- Post-deployment monitoring and validation

## Success Criteria
Validate all acceptance criteria from spec_refactor.md across all phases:
- All existing tests pass after all refactoring
- Zero import failures, proper API error handling, user-scoped duplicate detection
- RAG threshold at 0.3 with histogram logging and UUID traceability
- All deliverables completed as specified

## Constraints
- Follow deployment strategy and backwards compatibility requirements from rfc.md
- Implement all monitoring and success metrics outlined in todo.md
- Complete comprehensive validation before marking initiative as complete
