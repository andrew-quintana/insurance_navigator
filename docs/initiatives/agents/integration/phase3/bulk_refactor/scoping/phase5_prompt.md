# Phase 5: Development Testing & Validation - LLM Implementation Prompt

## Context
You are implementing Phase 5 of the Agent Integration Infrastructure Refactor initiative. This phase focuses on comprehensive testing and validation using the development database and local backend environment. **No production deployment is included in this phase.**

## Reference Documents
- **Primary Specification**: `@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/bulk_refactor/scoping/spec_refactor.md` - Review all "Acceptance Criteria" and "Deliverables" sections for complete validation requirements
- **Technical Design**: `@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/bulk_refactor/scoping/rfc.md` - Reference "Implementation Plan" Phase 5 section and "Monitoring & Metrics" for deployment strategy
- **Implementation Tasks**: `@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/bulk_refactor/scoping/todo.md` - Follow "Phase 5: Testing & Deployment" section for comprehensive testing and deployment procedures

## Key Implementation Areas
Refer to the RFC document sections for:
- Comprehensive integration testing in development environment
- Local backend validation and testing procedures
- Development database testing with all refactored components
- End-to-end workflow validation in local environment

## Success Criteria
Validate all acceptance criteria from spec_refactor.md in development environment:
- All existing tests pass after all refactoring in local backend
- Zero import failures, proper API error handling, document row duplication validated locally
- RAG threshold at 0.3 with histogram logging and UUID traceability working in development
- Development environment fully validates all implemented features

## Constraints
- Testing limited to development database and local backend only
- Focus on development environment validation rather than production deployment
- Complete comprehensive local testing and documentation before handoff
- Ensure all features work correctly in development environment
