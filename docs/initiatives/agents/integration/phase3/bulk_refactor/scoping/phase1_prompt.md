# Phase 1: Import Management Resolution - LLM Implementation Prompt

## Context
You are implementing Phase 1 of the Agent Integration Infrastructure Refactor initiative. This phase focuses on permanently resolving import management issues with psycopg2 and agents directory modules.

## Reference Documents
- **Primary Specification**: `@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/bulk_refactor/spec_refactor.md` - Review the "Current State" and "Target State" sections for import management requirements
- **Technical Design**: `@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/bulk_refactor/rfc.md` - Reference "1. Import Management Restructuring" section for detailed implementation approach
- **Implementation Tasks**: `@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/bulk_refactor/todo.md` - Follow "Phase 1: Import Management Resolution" section for specific task breakdown

## Key Implementation Areas
Refer to the RFC document section "1. Import Management Restructuring" for:
- Dependency injection pattern implementation
- Database connection management consolidation
- Module initialization order requirements
- CI/CD import validation setup

## Success Criteria
Implement all acceptance criteria listed in the spec_refactor.md document related to:
- Zero psycopg2 import failures
- Zero agents module import failures
- All existing tests passing after restructuring

## Constraints
- Follow the risks and constraints outlined in spec_refactor.md
- Maintain backward compatibility as specified in rfc.md
- Complete all Phase 1 tasks listed in todo.md before proceeding to Phase 2
