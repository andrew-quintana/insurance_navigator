# Agent Integration Infrastructure Refactor

## Summary
Comprehensive refactor of agent integration infrastructure to address critical import management issues, API reliability concerns, data integrity problems, and observability gaps. This refactor will permanently resolve psycopg2 and agents directory module import failures, ensure production API reliability, improve data consistency for multi-user scenarios, and enhance RAG system observability.

## Current State
- **Import Management**: Persistent import failures with psycopg2 and agents directory modules causing runtime errors
- **API Reliability**: Llamaparse calls falling back to mock implementations in production, masking real failures
- **Data Integrity**: Duplicate upload checks ignore user_id, preventing legitimate multi-user uploads of same documents
- **RAG Configuration**: Default similarity threshold may be too restrictive for optimal retrieval
- **Observability**: Limited visibility into RAG similarity score distributions, hampering optimization efforts

## Target State
- **Robust Import System**: Permanent resolution of all import dependencies with proper module structure
- **Production-Ready API Layer**: Reliable external API calls with proper error handling and traceability
- **Multi-User Data Integrity**: User-scoped duplicate detection allowing legitimate document sharing
- **Optimized RAG Performance**: Tuned similarity threshold (0.3) for improved retrieval quality
- **Enhanced Observability**: INFO-level histogram logging of cosine similarity distributions with UUIDs for traceability

## Risks & Constraints
- **Import Changes**: Risk of breaking existing functionality during dependency restructuring
- **API Behavior**: Production API failures will now surface as errors rather than silent fallbacks
- **Database Schema**: May require migration if user_id indexing needs optimization
- **Performance Impact**: Additional logging and histogram generation may affect response times (NOTE: RAG performance speeds are non-critical for this initiative)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing clients expecting mock fallback behavior may need updates

## Acceptance Criteria
- All existing tests pass after import restructuring
- No psycopg2 or agents module import failures in any environment
- Llamaparse production failures generate proper error responses with UUIDs
- Duplicate upload checks correctly scope by user_id
- RAG similarity threshold set to 0.3 across all configurations
- INFO logs include cosine similarity histograms with clear UUID traceability
- RAG functionality remains stable (performance speed is non-critical)
- Error messages include relevant UUIDs for support team traceability

## Deliverables
- Refactored import management system
- Production-ready API error handling layer
- Updated duplicate detection logic with user_id scoping
- RAG configuration updates with 0.3 threshold
- Enhanced logging system with similarity histograms
- Migration guides for any breaking changes
- Updated integration tests covering new error scenarios
- Documentation for new observability features
