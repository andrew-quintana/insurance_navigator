# Phase 2: Production API Reliability - LLM Implementation Prompt

## Context
You are implementing Phase 2 of the Agent Integration Infrastructure Refactor initiative. This phase focuses on establishing reliable external API calls for LlamaParse in production, eliminating mock fallbacks and implementing proper error handling with UUID traceability.

## Reference Documents
- **Primary Specification**: `@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/bulk_refactor/spec_refactor.md` - Review "API Reliability" sections in Current State and Target State
- **Technical Design**: `@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/bulk_refactor/rfc.md` - Reference "2. Production API Reliability" section for implementation details and code examples
- **Implementation Tasks**: `@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/bulk_refactor/todo.md` - Follow "Phase 2: Production API Reliability" section for LlamaParse integration tasks

## Key Implementation Areas
Refer to the RFC document section "2. Production API Reliability" for:
- Mock fallback removal in production environments
- Error handling implementation with UUID generation
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- User-facing error message enhancement

## Success Criteria
Implement all acceptance criteria listed in the spec_refactor.md document related to:
- LlamaParse production failures generating proper error responses with UUIDs
- Error messages including relevant UUIDs for support team traceability
- No silent fallbacks to mock implementations in production

## Constraints
- Follow the API behavior changes outlined in spec_refactor.md risks section
- Ensure no sensitive information in error messages as specified in rfc.md security considerations
- Complete all Phase 2 tasks listed in todo.md before proceeding to Phase 3
