# Implementation Prompt - Comprehensive RCA and Refactor Effort

## Context
You are tasked with implementing the comprehensive fixes identified in the RCA investigation for the Phase 3 validation issues. This is a critical production blocker that must be resolved systematically.

## Required References
Before beginning implementation, you MUST review and reference these documents:

- **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_rca_refactor/rca_spec_comprehensive_issues.md** - Root cause analysis specification and investigation framework
- **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_rca_refactor/rca_report_comprehensive_findings.md** - Detailed investigation results and identified root causes
- **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_rca_refactor/refactor_spec_comprehensive_fixes.md** - Implementation specification with technical details and code examples

## Implementation Approach
Follow the phased implementation plan outlined in the refactor specification, starting with Phase 1 (Critical Configuration Fixes) and proceeding systematically through all phases.

## Critical Success Factors
- All 5 identified root causes must be addressed
- Configuration management system must be overhauled
- Service integration issues must be resolved
- UUID standardization must be completed
- Authentication flow must be fixed

## Validation Requirements
- Each phase must be validated before proceeding to the next
- All tests must pass with 95%+ success rate
- Performance requirements must be met
- Production readiness criteria must be satisfied

## Implementation Prompt
Based on the comprehensive RCA findings and refactor specification, implement the systematic resolution of all critical issues identified during Phase 3 validation testing. Follow the phased approach and ensure all root causes are properly addressed with appropriate validation at each step.

Begin with Phase 1: Critical Configuration Fixes, referencing the specific technical implementations outlined in the refactor specification.
