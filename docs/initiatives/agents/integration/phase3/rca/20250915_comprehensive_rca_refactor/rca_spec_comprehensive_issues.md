# Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Spec - Comprehensive Issues Investigation

## Summary
Comprehensive investigation of all critical issues identified during Phase 3 validation testing on September 15, 2025. Multiple interconnected issues are preventing production readiness and must be resolved systematically.

## Problem Statement
- **Observable symptoms**: RAG tool configuration failures, similarity threshold not applied, worker processing hanging, UUID consistency issues, authentication flow problems
- **Impact on users/system**: Complete RAG system failure, users cannot retrieve uploaded documents, end-to-end workflow broken
- **When detected**: September 15, 2025 during Phase 3 validation testing with local development servers

## Initial Investigation
- **Initial theories**: Configuration management issues, service integration problems, database consistency issues, authentication flow breakdown
- **Key observations**: 
  - RAG tool functionality test failed with import/configuration errors
  - Similarity threshold test failed (0.3 threshold not properly applied)
  - Worker processing test hung indefinitely during end-to-end testing
  - UUID consistency partially validated but concerns remain
  - Authentication flow partially working but issues detected
- **Behavior patterns**: Multiple system components failing or partially working, suggesting systemic configuration or integration issues

## Investigation Steps

### Theory 1: Configuration Management System Failure
- **Context**: RAG tool and similarity threshold configuration not loading properly
- **Possible Issues**:
  - Environment variable configuration not properly loaded
  - Configuration files missing or corrupted
  - Service configuration not propagated correctly
  - Configuration validation failing silently
- **Task**: Investigate configuration loading and validation across all services
- **Goal**: Identify why configuration is not being applied correctly

### Theory 2: Service Integration Breakdown
- **Context**: Worker processing hanging suggests service communication issues
- **Possible Issues**:
  - Service discovery failures
  - Network connectivity issues between services
  - Service timeout configurations too aggressive
  - Deadlock in service communication
- **Task**: Test service-to-service communication and identify bottlenecks
- **Goal**: Resolve service integration issues causing processing hangs

### Theory 3: Database Consistency Problems
- **Context**: UUID consistency partially validated but concerns remain
- **Possible Issues**:
  - Previous UUID fixes not fully implemented
  - Database migration issues
  - Foreign key constraint violations
  - Data integrity problems
- **Task**: Comprehensive database consistency audit
- **Goal**: Ensure all data relationships are correct and consistent

### Theory 4: Authentication Flow Degradation
- **Context**: Authentication flow partially working but issues detected
- **Possible Issues**:
  - JWT token validation problems
  - User ID propagation failures
  - Session management issues
  - Authorization service problems
- **Task**: Trace authentication flow from login through service calls
- **Goal**: Ensure complete authentication flow works correctly

### Theory 5: Environment Configuration Mismatch
- **Context**: Tests work in some environments but fail in others
- **Possible Issues**:
  - Development vs production environment differences
  - Missing environment variables
  - Service configuration mismatches
  - Dependency version conflicts
- **Task**: Compare working and non-working environments
- **Goal**: Identify and resolve environment-specific issues

## Root Cause Analysis Framework

### **Investigation Methodology**
1. **Systematic Component Testing**: Test each component in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions
3. **Configuration Audit**: Verify all configuration is correct
4. **Environment Comparison**: Compare working vs failing environments
