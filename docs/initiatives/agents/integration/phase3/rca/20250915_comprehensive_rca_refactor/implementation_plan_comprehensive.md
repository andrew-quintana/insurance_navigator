## Implementation Dependencies

### **Critical Dependencies**
- **Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2**: Configuration system must be working before service integration
- **Phase 2 ‚Üí Phase 3**: Service communication must be stable before UUID migration
- **Phase 3 ‚Üí Phase 4**: Database consistency must be ensured before authentication fixes
- **Phase 4 ‚Üí Phase 5**: All functionality must be working before monitoring implementation

### **Parallel Work Opportunities**
- **Phase 1.1 & 1.2**: Can be done in parallel (configuration system and RAG fixes)
- **Phase 2.1 & 2.2**: Can be done in parallel (worker fixes and monitoring)
- **Phase 3.1 & 3.2**: Can be done in parallel (UUID system and migration)
- **Phase 4.1 & 4.2**: Can be done in parallel (JWT fixes and service auth)

## Risk Mitigation

### **High-Risk Items**
1. **Configuration System Changes**
   - **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, gradual rollout
   - **Rollback**: Revert to previous configuration system

2. **Database Migration**
   - **Risk**: Data loss or corruption
   - **Mitigation**: Complete backup, staged migration
   - **Rollback**: Restore from backup, revert migration

3. **Service Integration Changes**
