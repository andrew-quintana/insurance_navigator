# CONTEXT 001 — Comprehensive System Refactor

## Objective
Resolve critical system integration issues preventing Phase 3 production deployment by implementing a comprehensive refactor addressing RAG tool integration failures, configuration management problems, database schema inconsistencies, and UUID generation conflicts that are blocking end-to-end user workflow functionality.

## Scope
- In: Service architecture refactor, configuration management overhaul, database schema standardization, UUID generation unification, RAG system integration, error handling and resilience
- Out: UI/UX changes, new feature development, external API modifications, infrastructure changes beyond service configuration

## Adjacent & Integrating Components
- [Main API Service rollup](/docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/rollups/main_api_service_rollup.md)
- [RAG System IMPL](/docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/impl_notes/rag_system/IMPL.md)
- [Database Schema TESTS](/docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/test_summaries/database_schema/TESTS.md)
- [Configuration Management DEBT](/docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/tech_debt/configuration_management/DEBT.md)
- [Upload Pipeline rollup](/docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/rollups/upload_pipeline_rollup.md)
- [Authentication System IMPL](/docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/impl_notes/authentication_system/IMPL.md)
- [Monitoring Infrastructure TESTS](/docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/test_summaries/monitoring_infrastructure/TESTS.md)

## Interface Contracts to Preserve (verbatim if possible)
- `/api/v2/upload` endpoint signature and response format
- `/chat` endpoint request/response format and authentication
- RAG tool `retrieve_chunks(query_embedding: List[float]) -> List[ChunkWithContext]` interface
- Database schema foreign key relationships and constraints
- JWT token validation and user authentication flow
- Supabase client initialization and connection patterns

## Risks & Constraints from Adjacent Systems
- Phase 3 deployment timeline cannot be delayed beyond 4 weeks
- Existing user data must be preserved during UUID migration
- External API rate limits and costs must be considered in RAG optimization
- Database migration must maintain referential integrity
- Service downtime must be minimized during refactor deployment

## Context Budget
- Max: 20k tokens; 40/40/20 (context/rollups/snippets); overflow → keep signatures.

## Deliverables
- PRD001.md, RFC001.md, TODO001.md
- Refactored service architecture with proper integration
- Standardized database schema and configuration management
- Unified UUID generation and RAG system integration
- Production-ready error handling and monitoring

## Isolation
Isolation: false
Isolation_Justification: This refactor affects core system components and requires integration with existing services, database, and external APIs. Complete isolation is not possible due to the interconnected nature of the issues being addressed.
