# PRD 001 — Comprehensive System Refactor

## Problem & Goals

### Problem Statement
The Insurance Navigator system is experiencing critical integration failures that prevent core functionality from working end-to-end. Despite individual components functioning in isolation, the system integration layer has fundamental issues causing a 57.1% test success rate and complete failure of the document-to-chat workflow that represents the core value proposition.

### Business Impact
- **User Experience**: Complete breakdown of core user journey (document upload → chat interaction)
- **Production Readiness**: System not ready for Phase 3 cloud deployment
- **Business Value**: Core value proposition (document-based AI chat) non-functional
- **Technical Debt**: Accumulated integration issues blocking all forward progress

### Goals
- **Primary Goal**: Achieve 100% end-to-end workflow functionality (document upload → processing → RAG retrieval → chat response)
- **Secondary Goal**: Establish production-ready system with 99%+ reliability and proper error handling
- **Tertiary Goal**: Create maintainable, scalable architecture supporting future growth

## Adjacent Systems Considered (with citations + dates)

  - Impact on design choices: Core functionality requiring proper initialization, configuration, and database integration
- **Database Schema** — last_updated: 2025-09-15 — [rollup] [impl] [tests] [debt]
  - Impact on design choices: Schema standardization required for consistent data access patterns
- **Upload Pipeline** — last_updated: 2025-09-15 — [rollup] [impl] [tests] [debt]
  - Impact on design choices: UUID generation standardization required for pipeline continuity
- **Configuration Management** — last_updated: 2025-09-15 — [rollup] [impl] [tests] [debt]
  - Impact on design choices: Centralized configuration system required for environment-specific settings

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Epic 1: Service Integration and Architecture
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** all services to be properly initialized and integrated  
**So that** the system functions reliably end-to-end

#### User Story 1.1: RAG Tool Integration
**As a** user  
**I want** to chat with my uploaded documents  
**So that** I can get answers based on my insurance information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] RAG tool is properly initialized in main API service startup
- [ ] RAG tool responds to queries within 2 seconds average
- [ ] RAG tool returns relevant results for uploaded documents
- [ ] RAG tool handles errors gracefully with appropriate fallbacks

#### User Story 1.2: Configuration Management
**As a** developer  
**I want** environment-specific configurations to load correctly  
**So that** the system behaves consistently across environments

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Similarity threshold loads correctly (0.3 for production, configurable per environment)
- [ ] Database connection settings load from environment variables
- [ ] Service endpoints resolve correctly based on environment
- [ ] Configuration validation fails fast with clear error messages

### Epic 2: Database Schema and Data Flow
**As a** system  
**I want** consistent database schema and data flow  
**So that** all operations work reliably and efficiently

#### User Story 2.1: Schema Standardization
**As a** developer  
**I want** consistent table names and schema references  
**So that** database queries work reliably across all components

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All code references correct table names (document_chunks, not chunks)
- [ ] Database queries use proper JOIN operations
- [ ] Foreign key relationships are maintained correctly
- [ ] Schema migrations are versioned and reversible

#### User Story 2.2: UUID Generation Consistency
**As a** system  
**I want** consistent UUID generation across all pipeline stages  
**So that** documents can be tracked from upload to retrieval

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Upload endpoints use deterministic UUID generation (UUIDv5)
- [ ] Processing workers can find documents using matching UUIDs
- [ ] Chunks are created with proper document_id references
- [ ] RAG queries can retrieve chunks using consistent UUIDs

### Epic 3: Error Handling and Resilience
**As a** user  
**I want** the system to handle errors gracefully  
**So that** I can continue using the system even when components fail

#### User Story 3.1: Graceful Error Handling
**As a** user  
**I want** clear error messages when something goes wrong  
**So that** I understand what happened and can take appropriate action

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Service failures return appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] System logs contain detailed error information for debugging
- [ ] Critical errors trigger appropriate alerts and monitoring

#### User Story 3.2: Service Resilience
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** the system to continue functioning when individual components fail  
**So that** users can still access core functionality

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms provide degraded but functional service
- [ ] Service health checks detect and report component failures
- [ ] Automatic recovery mechanisms restore service when possible

## Metrics / Guardrails
- **Backward-compat with** existing API endpoints, database schema, and user authentication
- **Error budget**: <1% error rate for critical user workflows
- **Integration test pass rate**: 100% for end-to-end workflows
- **Performance targets**: Document upload <500ms, RAG query <2s, complete workflow <10s
- **Reliability targets**: 99%+ uptime, <5s mean time to recovery
- **Code quality**: 90%+ test coverage, zero critical security vulnerabilities

## Risks / Open Questions

### High-Risk Items
1. **Database Migration Complexity**: Existing data with random UUIDs may require complex migration
   - **Mitigation**: Implement hybrid approach supporting both UUID types during transition
   - **Fallback**: Leave existing data unchanged, fix only new uploads

2. **Service Integration Dependencies**: Changes to core services may affect multiple components
   - **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive integration testing and staged rollout
   - **Fallback**: Rollback procedures for each service component

3. **Configuration Management Complexity**: Centralized configuration may introduce new failure modes
   - **Mitigation**: Implement configuration validation and fallback to defaults
   - **Fallback**: Hardcoded fallback values for critical settings

### Open Questions
1. **UUID Migration Strategy**: Should existing random UUIDs be migrated or left unchanged?
2. **Configuration Scope**: Which settings should be centralized vs. service-specific?
3. **Error Handling Granularity**: What level of error detail should be exposed to users?
4. **Performance vs. Reliability**: How to balance performance optimization with error handling overhead?
5. **Monitoring Integration**: How to integrate with existing monitoring without disrupting current alerts?
