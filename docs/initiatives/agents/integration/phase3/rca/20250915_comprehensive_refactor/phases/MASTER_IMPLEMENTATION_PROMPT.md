# Master Implementation Prompt - Comprehensive System Refactor

## Implementation Instructions

You are tasked with implementing the complete comprehensive system refactor for the Insurance Navigator. This is a **P0 CRITICAL** effort that must complete successfully to enable Phase 3 production deployment.

### Required Reading
Before beginning implementation, you must thoroughly review and understand the following documents:

1. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/README.md** - Overall problem statement and scope
2. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md** - High-level summary and business impact
3. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/CONTEXT.md** - Context and adjacent components
4. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/PRD001.md** - Product requirements and acceptance criteria
5. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/RFC001.md** - Technical architecture and implementation details
6. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/TODO001.md** - Detailed task breakdown for all phases
7. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/rca_spec_comprehensive_system_failures.md** - Root cause analysis of all issues
8. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/testing_spec_comprehensive_validation.md** - Testing requirements and validation criteria
9. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/ADJACENT_INDEX.md** - Component index with all rollup references

### Phase-Specific Implementation Prompts
Execute each phase in sequence using the following phase-specific prompts:

- **Phase 1**: @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/phases/PHASE_1_CRITICAL_SERVICE_INTEGRATION_PROMPT.md
- **Phase 2**: @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/phases/PHASE_2_PIPELINE_DATA_FLOW_REFACTOR_PROMPT.md
- **Phase 3**: @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/phases/PHASE_3_PRODUCTION_READINESS_HARDENING_PROMPT.md
- **Phase 4**: @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/phases/PHASE_4_MONITORING_OPERATIONS_PROMPT.md

### Implementation Approach
1. **Sequential Execution**: Complete each phase in order, ensuring all success criteria are met before proceeding
2. **Documentation-Driven**: Reference the specified documents to understand requirements and constraints
3. **Validation-First**: Run validation tests after each phase to ensure requirements are met
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Follow the risk mitigation strategies defined in the TODO001.md document

### Critical Success Factors
- **Phase 1 is P0 CRITICAL** - Must complete successfully before any other work
- **Each phase builds on the previous** - Cannot skip phases or proceed without completion
- **All success criteria must be met** - As defined in PRD001.md for each phase
- **Comprehensive testing required** - As specified in testing_spec_comprehensive_validation.md

### Timeline and Dependencies
- **Total Duration**: 4 weeks (1 week per phase)
- **Phase Dependencies**: Each phase requires successful completion of previous phases
- **Phase 3 Dependency**: Must complete before Phase 3 cloud deployment
- **Resource Requirements**: As specified in the EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md document

### Quality Gates
- **Phase Completion**: Each phase must meet all success criteria before proceeding
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end testing required after each phase
- **Performance Validation**: Performance targets must be met as specified
- **Security Validation**: Security requirements must be met as specified

### Emergency Procedures
If critical issues arise during implementation, refer to the risk mitigation strategies in TODO001.md and the contingency plans in the EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md document.

### Final Validation
Upon completion of all phases, the system must achieve:
- **100% End-to-End Functionality**: Complete user workflow from upload to chat
- **Production Readiness**: All Phase 3 success criteria met
- **Operational Excellence**: Comprehensive monitoring and documentation
- **Performance Targets**: All performance requirements met or exceeded

Begin implementation immediately upon reviewing the referenced documents, starting with Phase 1.
