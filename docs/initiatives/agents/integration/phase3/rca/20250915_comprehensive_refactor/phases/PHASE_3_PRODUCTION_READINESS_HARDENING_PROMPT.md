# Phase 3 Implementation Prompt - Production Readiness and Hardening

## Implementation Instructions

You are tasked with implementing Phase 3 of the comprehensive system refactor. This phase focuses on preparing the system for production deployment and requires successful completion of Phases 1 and 2.

### Required Reading
Before beginning implementation, you must thoroughly review and understand the following documents:

1. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/README.md** - Overall problem statement and scope
2. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/PRD001.md** - Product requirements and acceptance criteria
3. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/RFC001.md** - Technical architecture and implementation details
4. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/TODO001.md** - Detailed task breakdown for Phase 3
5. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/rca_spec_comprehensive_system_failures.md** - Root cause analysis of error handling and resilience issues
6. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/testing_spec_comprehensive_validation.md** - Testing requirements and performance criteria
7. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/rollups/main_api_service_rollup.md** - Main API service component details
8. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/rollups/rag_system_rollup.md** - RAG system component details
9. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/rollups/configuration_management_rollup.md** - Configuration management component details

### Implementation Scope
Implement all Phase 3 tasks as defined in the TODO001.md document, specifically:

- **3.1 Error Handling and Resilience** - Graceful degradation, circuit breakers, recovery mechanisms, monitoring
- **3.2 Performance and Scalability** - Performance optimization, scalability testing, resource management, caching
- **3.3 Security and Compliance** - Security hardening, data protection, access control, audit logging

### Prerequisites
- Phases 1 and 2 must be completed successfully before beginning Phase 3
- All Phase 1 and 2 success criteria must be met and validated
- Core functionality must be working end-to-end

### Success Criteria
Your implementation must meet all Phase 3 success criteria as defined in the PRD001.md document. The system must achieve production readiness with 99%+ reliability after Phase 3 completion.

### Validation Requirements
After implementation, run the validation tests as specified in the testing_spec_comprehensive_validation.md document to ensure all Phase 3 requirements are met, including performance and security testing.

### Critical Notes
- This phase prepares the system for production deployment
- You must reference the testing specification to understand performance and security requirements
- Follow the technical architecture defined in RFC001.md for production patterns
- Ensure all security and compliance requirements are met
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting as specified

Begin implementation only after Phases 1 and 2 completion and thorough review of the referenced documents.
