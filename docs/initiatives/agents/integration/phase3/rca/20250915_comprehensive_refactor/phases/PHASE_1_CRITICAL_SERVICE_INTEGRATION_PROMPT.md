# Phase 1 Implementation Prompt - Critical Service Integration

## Implementation Instructions

You are tasked with implementing Phase 1 of the comprehensive system refactor. This is a **P0 CRITICAL** phase that must complete successfully before any other work can proceed.

### Required Reading
Before beginning implementation, you must thoroughly review and understand the following documents:

1. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/README.md** - Overall problem statement and scope
2. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/PRD001.md** - Product requirements and acceptance criteria
3. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/RFC001.md** - Technical architecture and implementation details
4. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/TODO001.md** - Detailed task breakdown for Phase 1
5. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/rca_spec_comprehensive_system_failures.md** - Root cause analysis of issues to be resolved
6. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/rollups/main_api_service_rollup.md** - Main API service component details
7. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/rollups/rag_system_rollup.md** - RAG system component details
8. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/rollups/configuration_management_rollup.md** - Configuration management component details
9. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/rollups/database_schema_rollup.md** - Database schema component details

### Implementation Scope
Implement all Phase 1 tasks as defined in the TODO001.md document, specifically:

- **1.1 RAG Tool Integration Fix** - Fix RAG tool initialization in main.py, configuration management, service dependencies, error handling
- **1.2 Database Schema Standardization** - Schema alignment, query standardization, migration management, data integrity
- **1.3 Configuration System Overhaul** - Environment management, similarity threshold fix (0.3), validation, hot-reloading

### Success Criteria
Your implementation must meet all Phase 1 success criteria as defined in the PRD001.md document. The system must achieve 100% end-to-end workflow functionality after Phase 1 completion.

### Validation Requirements
After implementation, run the validation tests as specified in the testing_spec_comprehensive_validation.md document to ensure all Phase 1 requirements are met.

### Critical Notes
- This is a P0 CRITICAL phase that blocks all other work
- You must reference the documents above to understand the specific issues and solutions
- Follow the technical architecture defined in RFC001.md
- Ensure all interface contracts are preserved as specified in CONTEXT.md
- Maintain backward compatibility as defined in the PRD001.md metrics section

Begin implementation immediately upon reviewing the referenced documents.
