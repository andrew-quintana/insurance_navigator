# Phase 2 Implementation Prompt - Pipeline and Data Flow Refactor

## Implementation Instructions

You are tasked with implementing Phase 2 of the comprehensive system refactor. This phase focuses on establishing reliable data flow from upload to retrieval and requires successful completion of Phase 1.

### Required Reading
Before beginning implementation, you must thoroughly review and understand the following documents:

1. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/README.md** - Overall problem statement and scope
2. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/PRD001.md** - Product requirements and acceptance criteria
3. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/RFC001.md** - Technical architecture and implementation details
4. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/TODO001.md** - Detailed task breakdown for Phase 2
5. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/rca_spec_comprehensive_system_failures.md** - Root cause analysis of UUID and pipeline issues
6. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/202509100800_rag_conformance/uuid_refactor/RFC001_UUID_STANDARDIZATION.md** - UUID standardization architecture
7. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/202509100800_rag_conformance/uuid_refactor/UUID_STANDARDIZATION_REFACTOR_SPEC.md** - UUID refactor specifications
8. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/rollups/upload_pipeline_rollup.md** - Upload pipeline component details
9. **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/20250915_comprehensive_refactor/rollups/rag_system_rollup.md** - RAG system component details

### Implementation Scope
Implement all Phase 2 tasks as defined in the TODO001.md document, specifically:

- **2.1 UUID Generation Standardization** - Unified strategy, pipeline continuity, migration strategy, validation
- **2.2 Upload Pipeline Refactor** - End-to-end pipeline, error handling, monitoring, performance optimization
- **2.3 RAG System Integration** - Threshold management, query processing, chunk management, performance optimization

### Prerequisites
- Phase 1 must be completed successfully before beginning Phase 2
- All Phase 1 success criteria must be met and validated
- Service integration and configuration management must be functional

### Success Criteria
Your implementation must meet all Phase 2 success criteria as defined in the PRD001.md document. The system must achieve reliable data flow from upload to retrieval after Phase 2 completion.

### Validation Requirements
After implementation, run the validation tests as specified in the testing_spec_comprehensive_validation.md document to ensure all Phase 2 requirements are met.

### Critical Notes
- This phase addresses the critical UUID generation conflicts identified in the RCA
- You must reference the UUID standardization documents to understand the specific issues and solutions
- Follow the technical architecture defined in RFC001.md for pipeline design
- Ensure all interface contracts are preserved as specified in CONTEXT.md
- Maintain data integrity throughout the refactor process

Begin implementation only after Phase 1 completion and thorough review of the referenced documents.
