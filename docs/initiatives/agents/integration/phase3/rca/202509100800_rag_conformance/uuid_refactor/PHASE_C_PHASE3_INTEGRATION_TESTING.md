# Phase C: Phase 3 Integration Testing (Week 3)
## Cloud Deployment UUID Integration and Validation

**Phase**: C - Phase 3 Integration Testing  
**Timeline**: Week 3 (Days 1-5)  
**Priority**: üü¢ **MEDIUM - CLOUD DEPLOYMENT INTEGRATION**  
**Status**: üìã **DEPENDS ON PHASE A & B COMPLETION**

---

## Phase Overview

Phase C integrates our UUID standardization with Phase 3 cloud deployment testing. This phase ensures that our UUID fixes work correctly in the cloud environment and that all Phase 3 success criteria can be met with the UUID implementation.

**Key Objectives**:
- Validate UUID operations in cloud environment
- Integrate with Phase 3 testing framework  
- Ensure cloud service compatibility with UUID changes
- Validate production readiness for cloud deployment

---

## Implementation Prompt

```
I need to integrate our UUID standardization implementation with Phase 3 cloud deployment testing. Based on our successful Phase A fixes and Phase B migration, I now need to:

CURRENT STATE: UUID standardization working locally, Phase 3 cloud infrastructure being deployed.

INTEGRATION REQUIRED: Ensure UUID operations work correctly in cloud environment, validate with Phase 3 testing framework, and confirm production readiness.

CLOUD VALIDATION: Test UUID consistency across cloud services, validate performance under cloud constraints, and ensure monitoring works in cloud environment.

Please implement the complete Phase C solution addressing all TODO sections below to validate Phase 3 integration readiness.
```
