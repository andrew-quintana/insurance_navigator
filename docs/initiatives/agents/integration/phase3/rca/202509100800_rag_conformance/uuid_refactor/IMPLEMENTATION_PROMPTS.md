## Phase-by-Phase Implementation Guidance

**Document**: Implementation Prompts for UUID Standardization  
**Related**: PHASED_TODO_IMPLEMENTATION.md, RFC001_UUID_STANDARDIZATION.md  
**Status**: ðŸš¨ **READY FOR EXECUTION**

---

## Phase A: Critical Path Resolution (Week 1)

### **A.1: Emergency UUID Fix (Days 1-2)**

#### **A.1.1: Core UUID Utility Implementation Prompt**

```
I need to create a centralized UUID generation system to fix the critical UUID mismatch issue in our upload pipeline. Based on our RCA findings at @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/uuid_refactor/RFC001_UUID_STANDARDIZATION.md, please:

1. Create a new file `utils/uuid_generation.py` with a UUIDGenerator class
2. Implement deterministic UUID generation using:
   - System namespace: '6c8a1e6e-1f0b-4aa8-9f0a-1a7c2e6f2b42'
   - Document UUIDs: UUIDv5(namespace, f"{user_id}:{file_sha256}")
   - Chunk UUIDs: UUIDv5(namespace, f"{document_id}:{chunker}:{version}:{ordinal}")
3. Include comprehensive type hints and docstrings
4. Add validation methods for UUID format and deterministic generation
5. Ensure the implementation matches the specifications in our RFC001 document

The goal is to replace all random UUID generation with deterministic UUIDs to fix our broken RAG pipeline.
```

#### **A.1.2: Upload Endpoint Critical Fixes Prompt**

```
I need to fix the critical UUID generation issues in our upload endpoints that are breaking the RAG pipeline. Based on the analysis in @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/202509100800_rag_conformance/rca002_ai_conclusion.md, please:

1. Fix main.py lines 373-376:
   - Replace `document_id = str(uuid.uuid4())` with deterministic UUID generation
   - Remove `user_id = str(uuid.uuid4())` and use actual authenticated user ID
   - Import and use the new UUIDGenerator from utils/uuid_generation.py

2. Fix api/upload_pipeline/endpoints/upload.py line 92:
   - Replace random document_id generation with deterministic generation
   - Use user_id and file content hash for UUID generation

3. Update api/upload_pipeline/utils/upload_pipeline_utils.py:
   - Replace the generate_document_id() function to accept user_id and content_hash
   - Use deterministic UUID generation instead of random

The critical issue is that upload endpoints create random UUIDs while workers expect deterministic ones, causing complete pipeline failure. This fix must preserve user authentication and enable proper document tracking.
```

### **A.2: Immediate Validation Testing (Days 3-4)**

#### **A.2.1: Pipeline Continuity Testing Prompt**

```
I need to create comprehensive tests to validate that our UUID standardization fix works end-to-end. Based on our implementation in Phase A.1, please:

1. Create an end-to-end test that:
   - Uploads a document via the fixed upload endpoint
   - Verifies the document gets a deterministic UUID based on user_id + content_hash
   - Confirms the worker can find and process the document using the same UUID
   - Tests that chunks are created with proper document_id references
   - Validates that RAG queries can retrieve the uploaded content

2. Create UUID consistency tests:
   - Test that same user + same content = same document UUID
   - Test that different users + same content = different UUIDs  
   - Test that chunk UUIDs are deterministic and properly reference documents
   - Verify no UUID format violations or namespace inconsistencies

3. Test the fixed user authentication:
   - Verify user_id override is removed and actual authenticated users are preserved
   - Test user isolation (users only see their own documents via RAG)
   - Confirm proper foreign key relationships in database

Focus on testing the upload â†’ processing â†’ embedding â†’ RAG retrieval pipeline that was completely broken before our fix.
```

#### **A.2.2: UUID Consistency Validation Prompt**

```
I need to create validation scripts to ensure our UUID standardization is working correctly across the entire system. Please:

1. Create a UUID validation script that:
   - Scans the database for UUID format consistency
   - Validates that document UUIDs follow the deterministic pattern
   - Checks that chunk UUIDs properly reference their parent documents
   - Identifies any remaining random UUIDs that need migration

2. Create database integrity checks:
   - Verify all document_chunks.document_id foreign keys are valid
   - Check for orphaned chunks or documents
   - Validate that user_ids are authentic (not randomly generated)
   - Test query performance with the new UUID distribution

3. Create a UUID regeneration test:
   - Given the same inputs, verify UUIDs are regenerated identically
   - Test that the namespace UUID is consistent across all generation
   - Validate that the canonical string format matches our specification

This validation is critical to confirm our fix resolves the UUID mismatch issue identified in RCA002.
```

### **A.3: Production Readiness Testing (Day 5)**

#### **A.3.1: Performance Validation Prompt**

```
I need to validate that our UUID standardization fix meets performance requirements and doesn't introduce regressions. Please:

1. Create performance tests for UUID operations:
   - Measure UUID generation latency (target: no significant increase vs UUIDv4)
   - Test concurrent UUID generation under load
   - Measure memory usage impact of deterministic generation
   - Benchmark database query performance with new UUID patterns

2. Test the complete pipeline performance:
   - Document upload with UUID generation: target < 500ms
   - RAG query response time: target < 2s average
   - End-to-end upload to searchable: target < 10s
   - Concurrent user testing with UUID consistency

3. Create regression tests:
   - Verify all existing Phase 1 and Phase 2 tests still pass
   - Confirm no functionality broken by UUID changes
   - Test that authentication and authorization are unchanged
   - Validate that non-UUID operations are unaffected

The goal is to ensure our critical UUID fix doesn't compromise system performance or introduce new issues.
```

#### **A.3.2: Regression Testing Prompt**

```
I need comprehensive regression testing to ensure our UUID fix doesn't break existing functionality. Based on our Phase 1 and Phase 2 test suites, please:

1. Run all existing integration tests and identify any failures:
   - Check if any tests were depending on random UUID behavior
   - Update test expectations to work with deterministic UUIDs
   - Verify that test data setup still works with new UUID strategy

2. Test error handling scenarios:
   - Invalid or missing user_id during UUID generation
   - Malformed file hashes causing UUID generation failures
   - Database constraint violations with new UUID patterns
   - Network failures during UUID-dependent operations

3. Validate authentication and authorization:
   - Confirm user isolation still works with deterministic UUIDs
   - Test that users can't access other users' documents
   - Verify JWT token handling unchanged
   - Test API security with new UUID patterns

This regression testing is critical to ensure our fix doesn't introduce new vulnerabilities or break existing user workflows.
```

## Phase B: Data Migration and Hardening (Week 2)

### **B.1: Existing Data Assessment (Days 1-2)**

#### **B.1.1: Data Inventory and Analysis Prompt**

```
I need to assess the impact of our UUID standardization on existing data and plan migration strategy. Please:

1. Create a data analysis script that:
   - Identifies all documents with random UUIDs (UUIDv4 patterns)
   - Counts affected documents by user and upload date
   - Finds orphaned chunks that reference non-existent documents
   - Calculates storage and processing impact of affected data

2. Generate migration planning reports:
   - List of high-priority documents (recent, frequently accessed)
   - User impact assessment (how many users affected, which users)
   - Data relationships that need updating (chunks, embeddings, jobs)
   - Estimate of migration complexity and time requirements

3. Create data consistency analysis:
   - Find documents that were uploaded but never processed (UUID mismatch victims)
   - Identify users whose documents became inaccessible due to UUID issues
   - Calculate the scope of the RAG retrieval problem we're solving

Reference the UUID patterns from @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/uuid_refactor/RFC001_UUID_STANDARDIZATION.md for determining what needs migration.
```

#### **B.1.2: Migration Strategy Planning Prompt**

```
Based on the data inventory from B.1.1, I need to develop a migration strategy that minimizes user impact. Please:

1. Analyze migration options:
   - Option A: Full migration - regenerate UUIDs for all existing documents
   - Option B: Hybrid approach - migrate recent/important documents only  
   - Option C: Forward-only - fix new uploads, leave existing data unchanged
   - Recommend the best approach based on data analysis and risk assessment

2. Plan user communication strategy:
   - Draft user notification about the UUID fix and its benefits
   - Explain any temporary limitations during migration
   - Provide timeline for when all documents will be accessible via RAG
   - Create FAQ for common user questions about the migration

3. Develop rollback strategy:
   - Plan for reverting migration if critical issues discovered
   - Identify rollback decision points and criteria
   - Document recovery procedures for partial migration failures
   - Ensure business continuity during migration process

The goal is a migration approach that restores RAG functionality with minimal user disruption while supporting Phase 3 timeline.
```

### **B.2: Migration Utilities Development (Days 3-4)**

   - Updates all references in document_chunks table to use new document UUIDs
   - Updates embeddings and any other tables that reference document UUIDs
   - Maintains referential integrity throughout the migration process

2. Build validation and rollback tools:
   - Pre-migration validation to ensure data consistency
   - Post-migration validation to confirm successful UUID updates
   - Rollback script to revert changes if issues discovered
   - Data integrity checking at each step of migration

3. Implement batch processing capabilities:
   - Process migration in chunks to avoid locking the database
   - Progress tracking and resumability for large migrations
   - Error handling and logging for debugging migration issues
   - Performance monitoring during migration execution

The migration must be safe, resumable, and maintain data integrity throughout the process.
```

#### **B.2.2: Monitoring and Alerting Prompt**

```
I need comprehensive monitoring for UUID operations and migration progress. Please:

1. Create UUID-specific monitoring metrics:
   - UUID generation success/failure rates
   - Pipeline stage consistency (upload â†’ processing â†’ RAG)
   - Document accessibility rate via RAG queries
   - UUID format compliance across all tables

2. Build migration monitoring dashboards:
   - Migration progress tracking (percentage complete, estimated time remaining)

   - Performance impact of migration on system operations

3. Set up alerting for critical issues:
   - UUID generation failures in production
   - UUID mismatches detected between pipeline stages  
   - RAG retrieval failure rate above acceptable threshold
   - Data integrity violations during migration

This monitoring will help us catch issues early and provide visibility into the success of our UUID standardization.
```

### **B.3: Production Migration Execution (Day 5)**

1. Prepare pre-migration checklist:
   - Complete system backup and verify recovery procedures
   - Validate migration tools in staging with production data copy  
   - Confirm monitoring and alerting systems are operational
   - Notify stakeholders of migration timeline and expected impact

2. Execute staged production migration:
   - Start with small batch of documents to validate process
   - Monitor system performance and data integrity after each batch
   - Implement pause/resume capability for migration process
   - Execute larger batches during low-traffic periods

3. Implement real-time validation:
   - Validate data integrity after each migration batch
   - Test RAG functionality with newly migrated documents
   - Monitor system performance impact during migration
   - Immediate rollback trigger if critical issues detected

The migration must be executed safely with minimal user impact and full recovery capability if issues arise.
```

#### **B.3.2: Post-Migration Validation Prompt**

```
After completing the migration, I need comprehensive validation to ensure success. Please:

1. Perform complete system validation:
   - Test end-to-end pipeline functionality with migrated data
   - Verify RAG queries return results for previously inaccessible documents
   - Confirm all UUID consistency checks pass
   - Validate that no data was lost or corrupted during migration
