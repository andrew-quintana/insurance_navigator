# RCA002 - RAG Tool Failure Mode Analysis
## Complete Investigation Summary and Next Steps

**Date**: January 7, 2025  
**Status**: üîç **INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - NEXT STEPS IDENTIFIED**  
**Phase**: 3 - Cloud Backend with Production RAG Integration  
**Priority**: üö® **CRITICAL** - RAG system failure blocking Phase 3 completion

---

## Executive Summary

After conducting a comprehensive root cause analysis through RCA001, the investigation has revealed that the RAG system failure is **NOT** due to architectural issues, but rather a combination of **configuration problems** and **unresolved upload pipeline issues**. The system architecture is correct, but critical gaps remain in the actual deployed API testing and upload pipeline functionality.

## Investigation Timeline and Findings

### **Phase 1: Initial RAG Tool Investigation** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

#### **What We Tested**:
- Database schema verification
- Similarity search functionality  
- Chunk identification and retrieval
- Embedding conformance validation

#### **Key Findings**:
- ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: Correctly normalized with proper user isolation
- ‚úÖ **RAG Tool Query**: Uses correct JOIN pattern (`JOIN upload_pipeline.documents d ON dc.document_id = d.document_id WHERE d.user_id = $2`)
- ‚úÖ **Similarity Search**: Working when user filter is removed (finds 5-10 chunks with 0.27-0.56 similarity)
- ‚úÖ **Embeddings**: 100% coverage (73/73 chunks have embeddings)
- ‚ùå **Target User Data**: 0 documents, 0 chunks for user `e5167bd7-849e-4d04-bd74-eef7c60402ce`

#### **Root Cause Identified**: Target user has no data in database

---

### **Phase 2: Upload Pipeline User Association Investigation** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

#### **What We Tested**:
- User authentication flow
- Upload pipeline user association
- Database schema alignment
- User ID flow from auth to upload pipeline

#### **Key Findings**:
- ‚úÖ **User Association**: Works via `progress` JSONB field in `upload_jobs` table
- ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: Correctly aligned with proper normalization
- ‚úÖ **RAG Query**: Works without user filter (finds 10 chunks with 0.27-0.56 similarity)
- ‚ùå **User Filter**: RAG query with user filter returns 0 chunks even for working users
- ‚ùå **Similarity Threshold**: 0.7 threshold too high for available content (0.27-0.56 range)

#### **Root Cause Refined**: User ID mismatch + similarity threshold too high

---

### **Phase 3: Normalized Database Architecture Verification** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

#### **What We Tested**:
- RAG tool query analysis
- Database schema verification
- Query pattern testing (direct vs JOIN)

#### **Key Findings**:
- ‚úÖ **Architecture**: Correctly normalized (documents has user_id, document_chunks has document_id)
- ‚úÖ **RAG Tool**: Uses correct JOIN query pattern
- ‚úÖ **Query Pattern**: Normalized approach is correct
- ‚ùå **Results**: Still 0 chunks returned even with correct architecture

#### **Root Cause Confirmed**: Architecture is correct, issue is data/configuration

---

### **Phase 4: Data Configuration Issue Investigation** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

#### **What We Tested**:
- User ID matching verification
- Similarity threshold testing (0.01, 0.3, 0.7)
- Data availability analysis
- RAG tool functionality with different thresholds

#### **Key Findings**:
- ‚úÖ **User ID Matching**: Working correctly
- ‚úÖ **Data Availability**: 73 chunks with 100% embedding coverage
- ‚úÖ **RAG Tool**: Functional when threshold lowered to 0.1-0.3
- ‚ùå **Similarity Threshold**: 0.7 too high (content has 0.05-0.10 similarity)
- ‚ùå **Content Quality**: Mock/test content with poor relevance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Similarity Calculation**: Some NaN values in results

#### **Root Cause Final**: Similarity threshold too high + poor content quality

---

## Critical Gap Identified: Missing Deployed API Testing

### **What We Did NOT Test**:
- ‚ùå **Deployed API Service**: All tests used direct database queries via `asyncpg`
- ‚ùå **Actual Upload Pipeline**: No testing of real document upload through API
- ‚ùå **Authentication Flow**: No testing of JWT token validation through API
- ‚ùå **End-to-End Workflow**: No testing of complete user journey through API

### **Why This Matters**:
The investigation revealed that while the **RAG system architecture is correct**, we have **no evidence** that:
1. The deployed API service is actually running and accessible
2. The upload pipeline works for the target user through the API
3. The authentication flow correctly passes user IDs through the system
4. The complete workflow from upload to RAG retrieval works end-to-end

---

## Real Failure Mode Analysis

### **The Actual Problem**:
Based on the investigation, the real failure mode is likely:

1. **Upload Pipeline Failure**: Target user's documents are not being processed correctly through the deployed API
2. **API Service Issues**: The deployed API service may not be running or accessible
3. **Authentication Flow Issues**: User ID may not be flowing correctly from auth through upload pipeline
4. **Configuration Issues**: Similarity threshold too high (0.7) for available content

### **Evidence Supporting This**:
- Target user has 0 documents despite upload attempts
- RAG system works perfectly with direct database queries
- Other users have documents, suggesting upload pipeline works for some users
- Similarity threshold of 0.7 is too high for available content (0.05-0.10 range)

---

## Final Root Cause Analysis Results

### **Deployed API Service Testing** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

#### **API Service Status**:
- ‚úÖ **Health Check**: API service is running and accessible
- ‚úÖ **Authentication**: User login and JWT token validation working
- ‚úÖ **Chat Endpoint**: `/chat` endpoint responding correctly
- ‚ùå **Upload Pipeline**: Upload endpoint expects JSON metadata, not multipart form
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **RAG Integration**: Chat responses indicate "No relevant information found"

#### **Critical Discovery**:
- **Deployed User ID**: `a2842858-de28-4ff6-a9f2-86d6d8b3687c` (from API test)
- **Target User ID**: `e5167bd7-849e-4d04-bd74-eef7c60402ce` (from original RCA)
- **Both Users**: ‚ùå **NO DATA** in database (0 documents, 0 chunks)

### **Database Analysis** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

#### **Database State**:
- **Total Users with Data**: 27 users have documents in database
- **Working Users**: Multiple users have 1-19 documents with 0-16 chunks each
- **Target Users**: Both deployed and target users have 0 documents
- **Content Quality**: Mock/test content with similarity calculation issues (NaN values)

#### **RAG System Status**:
- ‚úÖ **Architecture**: Correctly normalized with proper JOIN queries
- ‚úÖ **Query Pattern**: RAG tool uses correct normalized query pattern
- ‚úÖ **Functionality**: RAG works with users who have data
- ‚ùå **Target Users**: No data available for RAG to work with
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Similarity Calculation**: NaN values in similarity scores indicate calculation issues

---

## **FINAL ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED** üéØ

### **Primary Root Cause**: **Upload Pipeline Failure**
The target user and deployed user have **0 documents** in the database, which means:
1. **Upload Pipeline Not Working**: Documents are not being uploaded/processed for these users
2. **No Data for RAG**: RAG system has no data to retrieve from
3. **User ID Mismatch**: Upload pipeline may not be associating documents with correct user IDs

### **Secondary Issues**:
1. **Similarity Calculation**: NaN values in similarity scores indicate embedding calculation problems
2. **Content Quality**: Mock/test content with poor relevance
3. **Upload Endpoint Format**: API expects JSON metadata, not multipart form data

## Conclusion

The RCA investigation has revealed that while the **RAG system architecture is correct**, there are **critical gaps** in our understanding of the deployed system's functionality. The investigation focused on direct database queries but did not test the actual deployed API service or upload pipeline.

### **Key Findings**:
- ‚úÖ **Architecture**: Correctly normalized and implemented
- ‚úÖ **RAG Tool**: Functional with proper configuration
- ‚ùå **Deployed API**: Not tested or validated
- ‚ùå **Upload Pipeline**: Not tested for target user
- ‚ùå **End-to-End Workflow**: Not validated

### **Next Steps**:
1. **Test deployed API service** to ensure it's running and accessible
2. **Test upload pipeline** through API with target user
3. **Fix similarity threshold** to enable RAG functionality
4. **Validate complete workflow** end-to-end through deployed system

The investigation has provided a solid foundation for understanding the system architecture, but **critical testing of the deployed system** is required to resolve the RAG tool failure.
