# ATTEMPT 0
here are my observations from behavior and logs:
- interface: (per image) agentic output that is clearly generative because of the change in output. document upload appears to be complete from the frontend's perspective
- api service logs: (see below): 0 chunks were pulled before and after the upload (logs are similar but post upload is shown)
INFO:agent.information_retrieval:Expert reframe: the user is requesting assistance with: what is my annual deductible.
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:agent.information_retrieval:Retrieved 0 chunks, filtered to 0 with similarity >= 0.4
INFO:agent.information_retrieval:Retrieved 0 chunks - supabase: looking at the upload_jobs table, I see that ccd966a6-e90a-4bdf-af7c-ab03a26b8b52 was marked as being a duplicate. I'm not sure if the document was uploaded under this user before but this was a duplicate for other users.

# THEORY 1
my theory about the root cause: the document in the documents table only has one user_id associated with it. I don't think we have a way to capture when different  RCA PROBE 1 i attempted to upload a different document and saw 4 instances under upload_jobs for that point in time. I’m not too worried about htis issue and think it might be a red herring. let’s make a note to investigate LATER  RCA PROBE 1 OBSERVATIONS in attempting to chat after seeing the upload completed, I attempted another simple prompt and i got a connection error message (with no relevant logs in render) then an ai generated error message, similar to those before, and the render logs showed 0 chunks were found

# INVESTIGATION NEXT STEPS 1

I want you to probe and perform some root cause analysis by investigating logs (you can ask me to find and paste them if your attempts aren’t working), Supabase states, etc.  

**Login for attempts**:  
- **User:** `testuseraq@example.com`  
- **Pass:** `zoqgoz-zinmim-4Sesnu`  

I will provide some potential root cause avenues and next steps to pursue. After investigating these, I’m open to any you think are relevant as well.

---

## Root Cause 1: RAG Tool Failures

ALL IN THE PRODUCTION, CLOUD ENVIRONMENT: at a minimum, add debug logging to help gain an understanding of whether or not ALL of these might be the root cause, regardless of the more in-depth investigation you pursue

1. **Factor: Similarity Search, RAG Retrieval**  
   - Context: let's start by confirming the rag tool functionality is conforming
   - Task: Add debug logging that provides dynamic buckets for cosine similarity.  
   - Goal: confirm if chunks are being investigated for similarity, whether retrieval functionality is conforming, and whether output is possible.

1a. **Factor: Chunking Size**
    - Condition: IF we've determined that the similirity search is functioning as expected, checking the data that is being searched is next
    - Possible Issues: there are only two chunks for the document with ID `9a684097-2792-4dab-ac2d-8d40ef08e234`, which may be too large to get chunks with cosine similarity that are too small (this will be confirmed by the investigation in 1. as we'll see the buckets being below the threshold)
    - Task: test user 

1b. **Chunk Identification Investigation**
    - Condition: IF we confirm that the chunks aren't being queried for similarity search
    - Possible issues:  
        - UUID passing problems.  
        - Discrepancies between Supabase `documents` table and the index queried by `ragtool`.  
        - Note: We attempted to fix by removing a prefix on the user ID, but inconsistencies may remain.
    - Task: attempt to see what chunks are being pulled as part of the rag retrieval tool. if you can't directly, add logging for us to redeploy with
    - Goal: provide observability into chunk identification via uuid querying

1c. **Embedding Conformance**
    - Condition: IF the similarity bucket magnitudes appear to be conforming (0.1 - 0.5+) AND chunks are being queried
    - Possible issues: prompts may not be getting embedded by the same model as the chunks (`text-embedding-3-small`)
    - Task: investigate deployed code, configuration (mock vs external API), etc.
    - Goal: confirm that the prompt is being embedded by `text-embedding-3-small` for a similarity search for chunks

2. **Auth and RAG Tool**
    - Context: I don't see the user I'm logging in with under auth.users table. We moved away from using supabase auth and are using the bacekend to process users.
    - Task: {I don't know how to evaluate this so propose some avenues for investigating this and end the chat, waiting for my decision}
    - Goal: Determine if the user id (uuid) is being accepted as it is not in auth.users table

## Open Next Steps

- After investigating the above, explore any other potential root cause avenues you think are relevant.
