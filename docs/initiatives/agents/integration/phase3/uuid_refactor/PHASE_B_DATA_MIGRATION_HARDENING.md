# Phase B: Data Migration and Hardening (Week 2)
## UUID Data Migration and System Hardening

**Phase**: B - Data Migration and Hardening  
**Timeline**: Week 2 (Days 1-5)  
**Priority**: 🟡 **HIGH - PHASE 3 INTEGRATION PREPARATION**  
**Status**: 📋 **DEPENDS ON PHASE A COMPLETION**

---

## Phase Overview

Phase B focuses on migrating existing data to the new deterministic UUID strategy and hardening the system for production use. This phase prepares the system for Phase 3 cloud deployment by ensuring all data is consistent and the system is robust.

**Key Objectives**: 
- Assess and migrate existing data with random UUIDs
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and validation
- Prepare system for Phase 3 cloud integration
- Ensure data consistency across all pipeline stages

---

## Implementation Prompt

```
I need to implement data migration and system hardening for our UUID standardization. Phase A has fixed the critical UUID generation issues, now I need to:

CURRENT STATE: New uploads use deterministic UUIDs, but existing data may have random UUIDs that make documents inaccessible via RAG.

MIGRATION REQUIRED: Assess existing data impact, create migration tools, and execute safe data migration to restore access to all user documents.

HARDENING NEEDED: Implement monitoring, validation, and safeguards to prevent future UUID issues and prepare for Phase 3 cloud deployment.

Please implement the complete Phase B solution addressing all TODO sections below to prepare the system for Phase 3 integration.
```

**Priority**: HIGH | **Timeline**: 48 hours | **Owner**: Data Engineering Team

#### **TODO B.1.1: Comprehensive Data Inventory**
- [ ] **Identify documents with random UUIDs**
  ```sql
  -- Find documents that don't match deterministic pattern
  SELECT document_id, user_id, file_sha256, created_at, file_name
  FROM upload_pipeline.documents 
  WHERE document_id NOT IN (
    SELECT generate_deterministic_uuid(user_id::text, file_sha256) 
    FROM upload_pipeline.documents
  );
  ```
