# Phase A: Critical Path Resolution - UUID Standardization
## Emergency Implementation to Fix Broken RAG Pipeline

**Phase**: A - Critical Path Resolution  
**Timeline**: Week 1 (Days 1-5)  
**Priority**: ðŸš¨ **P0 CRITICAL BLOCKER**  
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ **READY FOR IMMEDIATE EXECUTION**

---

## Phase Overview

This is the most critical phase that must resolve the UUID generation mismatch breaking our RAG pipeline. Based on findings in **@docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/202509100800_rag_conformance/rca002_ai_conclusion.md**, upload endpoints use random UUIDs while workers expect deterministic ones, causing complete pipeline failure.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: This phase MUST complete successfully before Phase 3 Week 2 (Service Deployment) to avoid production deployment failure.

---

## Implementation Prompt

```
I need to implement Phase A of the UUID standardization to fix our critical RAG pipeline failure. This is a P0 blocker for Phase 3 cloud deployment.

REFERENCE DOCUMENTS:
- @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/uuid_refactor/RFC001_UUID_STANDARDIZATION.md (technical architecture)
- @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/202509100800_rag_conformance/rca002_ai_conclusion.md (root cause analysis)

- @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/uuid_refactor/PHASED_TODO_IMPLEMENTATION.md (detailed timeline and tasks)

CRITICAL ISSUE: Upload endpoints create random UUIDs while processing workers expect deterministic UUIDs, causing 100% RAG retrieval failure.

Please implement Phase A according to the specifications in the reference documents, following the TODO sections below as a checklist.
