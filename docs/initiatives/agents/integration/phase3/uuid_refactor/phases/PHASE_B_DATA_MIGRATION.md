# Phase B: Data Migration and Hardening - UUID Standardization
## Migration Strategy and Production Hardening

**Phase**: B - Data Migration and Hardening  
**Timeline**: Week 2 (Days 1-5)  
**Priority**: üü° **PHASE 3 INTEGRATION PREPARATION**  
**Status**: üìã **DEPENDENT ON PHASE A COMPLETION**

---

## Phase Overview

This phase addresses existing data with random UUIDs and hardens the system for production deployment. While Phase A fixes the core UUID generation for new uploads, Phase B ensures existing user data is accessible and the system is resilient for Phase 3 cloud deployment.

**DEPENDENCY**: Phase A must be 100% complete and validated before beginning Phase B.

## Implementation Prompt

```
I need to implement Phase B of the UUID standardization to handle existing data migration and production hardening. This phase prepares the system for Phase 3 cloud deployment.

REFERENCE DOCUMENTS:
- @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/uuid_refactor/PHASED_TODO_IMPLEMENTATION.md (detailed Phase B requirements and timeline)
- @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/uuid_refactor/RFC001_UUID_STANDARDIZATION.md (migration architecture and strategies)
- @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/uuid_refactor/UUID_STANDARDIZATION_REFACTOR_SPEC.md (migration deliverables)
- @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/202509100800_rag_conformance/rca002_ai_conclusion.md (data impact analysis)

OBJECTIVE: Migrate existing random UUID data to deterministic UUIDs and implement monitoring/hardening for production readiness.

Please implement Phase B according to the specifications in the reference documents, following the TODO sections below as a checklist.

## Risk Mitigation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Risk Items
- **Data Loss Risk**: Comprehensive backup and validation at each migration step
- **Performance Impact**: Staged migration with performance monitoring and rollback triggers
- **User Disruption**: Clear communication and minimal-impact migration scheduling  
- **Migration Failure**: Complete rollback procedures tested and ready

### üõ°Ô∏è Contingency Plans
- **Minimal Migration**: Focus on new data only if full migration impossible within timeline
- **Deferred Migration**: Delay comprehensive migration to post-Phase 3 if necessary
- **Partial Success**: Accept partial migration with user communication if critical issues arise

---

## Phase Completion

Upon successful completion of all TODO items and success criteria:

1. **Generate Phase B Completion Report** with migration statistics and system impact
2. **Validate Phase 3 Integration Readiness** - confirm system ready for cloud testing
3. **Document Lessons Learned** from migration process for future reference
4. **Proceed to Phase C** - Phase 3 integration testing with migrated system

**DECISION POINT**: Evaluate if system is sufficiently prepared for Phase 3 integration or if additional hardening required.

**Phase Status**: üìã **READY FOR EXECUTION AFTER PHASE A**  
**Dependencies**: Phase A 100% complete and validated  
**Next Phase**: Phase C - Phase 3 Integration Testing
