# Phase C: Phase 3 Integration Testing - UUID Standardization
## Cloud Environment Validation and Production Integration

**Phase**: C - Phase 3 Integration Testing  
**Timeline**: Week 3 (Days 1-5)  
**Priority**: üü¢ **CLOUD DEPLOYMENT INTEGRATION**  
**Status**: üìã **DEPENDENT ON PHASE A/B COMPLETION**

---

## Phase Overview

This phase validates that our UUID standardization works correctly in the Phase 3 cloud environment and integrates seamlessly with all cloud services. It runs parallel with Phase 3.3 Integration Testing to ensure our UUID fix doesn't interfere with cloud deployment success.

**CRITICAL INTEGRATION**: This phase must succeed for Phase 3 cloud deployment to meet its success criteria, particularly RAG functionality.

---

## Implementation Prompt

```
I need to implement Phase C of the UUID standardization to validate cloud environment compatibility and integrate with Phase 3 deployment testing. This ensures our UUID fix works correctly in the production cloud environment.

REFERENCE DOCUMENTS:
- @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/README.md (Phase 3 cloud architecture and requirements)

- @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/uuid_refactor/RFC001_UUID_STANDARDIZATION.md (cloud deployment architecture)

OBJECTIVE: Validate UUID standardization works in cloud environment and enables Phase 3 success criteria achievement.

Please implement Phase C according to the specifications in the reference documents, following the TODO sections below as a checklist.
