# Emergency Procedures - UUID Standardization
## Rollback and Recovery Procedures for Critical Issues

**Document**: Emergency Procedures  
**Priority**: üö® **CRITICAL INCIDENT RESPONSE**  
**Status**: üìã **READY FOR EMERGENCY USE**

---

## Emergency Rollback - Complete Implementation Failure

### üö® When to Use This Procedure
- Critical production issues caused by UUID standardization
- Complete RAG pipeline failure after UUID implementation
- Data integrity issues threatening user data
- Performance degradation blocking Phase 3 deployment

---

## Implementation Prompt

```
EMERGENCY: I need to execute complete rollback of UUID standardization implementation due to critical production issues. This is an emergency procedure to restore system functionality.

REFERENCE DOCUMENTS:
- @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/uuid_refactor/PHASED_TODO_IMPLEMENTATION.md (rollback procedures and contingency plans)
- @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/uuid_refactor/RFC001_UUID_STANDARDIZATION.md (original architecture to revert from)
- @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/rca/202509100800_rag_conformance/rca002_ai_conclusion.md (original broken state documentation)

CRITICAL OBJECTIVE: Restore system to functioning state before UUID standardization while preserving maximum data integrity.

Execute emergency rollback following the TODO sections below as urgent checklist items.
```

## üìã TODO: Emergency Rollback Execution

### ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Immediate System Restoration
- [ ] **Revert all upload endpoint code changes**
  - Restore main.py lines 373-376 to original random UUID generation
  - Revert api/upload_pipeline/endpoints/upload.py to original implementation
  - Restore api/upload_pipeline/utils/upload_pipeline_utils.py to random UUIDs
  - Reference original broken state documented in RCA002

- [ ] **Remove UUID utility modules**
  - Delete or disable utils/uuid_generation.py
  - Remove all imports of deterministic UUID generation
  - Restore original import statements in affected files
  - Clear any cached deterministic UUID values

- [ ] **Database rollback procedures**
  - Identify documents created with deterministic UUIDs during implementation
  - Assess data that cannot be accessed after rollback
  - Execute database rollback scripts if data migration occurred
  - Reference PHASED_TODO_IMPLEMENTATION.md rollback procedures

### ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: System Validation Post-Rollback
- [ ] **Validate system functionality restoration**
  - Test document upload functionality works (even with broken RAG)
  - Confirm no runtime errors from UUID-related code
  - Verify database integrity maintained
  - Test user authentication and authorization

- [ ] **Assess rollback impact**
  - Document which uploaded documents may become inaccessible
  - Identify users affected by rollback
  - Calculate data that was successfully processed with deterministic UUIDs
  - Plan communication to stakeholders about rollback impact

- [ ] **Prepare recovery planning**
  - Document specific issues that triggered emergency rollback
  - Analyze root cause of implementation failure
  - Plan fixes for identified issues before retry attempt
  - Reference PHASED_TODO_IMPLEMENTATION.md "Emergency and Rollback Prompts"

## Partial Failure Recovery - Component-Specific Issues

### üõ†Ô∏è When to Use This Procedure
- Specific UUID components failing while others work correctly
- Database migration issues affecting some but not all data
- Performance issues with specific UUID operations
- Service-specific UUID integration problems

---

## Implementation Prompt

```
I'm experiencing partial failures in UUID standardization implementation. I need to isolate working components and fix failing ones without complete rollback.

REFERENCE DOCUMENTS:
- @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/uuid_refactor/PHASED_TODO_IMPLEMENTATION.md (partial failure recovery procedures)
- @docs/initiatives/agents/integration/phase3/uuid_refactor/RFC001_UUID_STANDARDIZATION.md (component architecture)

OBJECTIVE: Maintain working UUID components while fixing specific failures, minimizing user impact and preserving system stability.

Execute partial recovery following the TODO sections below.
```

---

## üìã TODO: Partial Failure Recovery

### üîß TODO: Failure Isolation and Assessment
- [ ] **Identify working vs failing UUID components**
  - Test upload endpoint UUID generation independently
  - Verify worker pipeline UUID processing separately  
  - Test RAG retrieval UUID operations in isolation
  - Test database UUID operations and integrity

- [ ] **Assess impact of failing components**
  - Determine user impact from specific component failures
  - Calculate data affected by failing UUID operations
  - Identify workarounds to maintain system functionality
  - Priority ranking of component fixes needed

- [ ] **Implement temporary workarounds**
  - Create temporary solutions for failing UUID components
  - Ensure system continues functioning during component fixes
  - Minimize user impact from partial implementation
  - Maintain data integrity during recovery process

### üîß TODO: Targeted Component Fixes
- [ ] **Focus fixes on specific failing components**
  - Fix upload endpoint issues without affecting worker pipeline
  - Resolve database UUID issues in isolation  
  - Fix service integration issues independently
  - Reference RFC001 component architecture for isolation guidance

- [ ] **Test component fixes in isolation**
  - Validate each component fix independently
  - Test component integration after fixes
  - Ensure fixes don't affect working components
  - Progressive integration testing

- [ ] **Plan gradual component integration**
  - Integrate fixed components one at a time
  - Monitor system health after each component integration
  - Ready rollback for specific components if integration fails
  - Complete system validation after all components integrated
