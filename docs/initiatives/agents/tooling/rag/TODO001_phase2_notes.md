# MVP RAG System - Phase 2 Implementation Notes

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Phase 2 for the MVP Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. Phase 2 focuses on comprehensive testing, documentation, and validation to establish a robust baseline for future retrieval strategy experiments.

## Implementation Steps
- Expanded the test suite to cover:
  - Error handling (DB connection failure, SQL error, invalid embedding)
  - Edge cases (empty embedding, empty DB result, token budget exactly met, missing optional fields)
  - User-scoped access (mocked multi-user data)
  - Performance (retrieval time <200ms for mocked DB)
  - Resource cleanup (DB connection closed on error)
- Added API docstrings and type hints for all public classes and methods in `core.py`
- Updated `__init__.py` for clean imports and module-level documentation
- All tests pass, including new edge and error cases
- No blockers for Phase 2 completion

## Next Steps
- Finalize API documentation and agent integration guide
- Complete performance validation and document results
- Establish MVP baseline for future retrieval strategy experiments 

## Test Environment and Import Path Fixes

During Phase 2, several issues with the Python test environment and project structure were identified and resolved:
- Added missing `__init__.py` files to `tests/` and `config/` to ensure proper package recognition.
- Renamed `tests/supabase/` to `tests/supabase_tests/` to avoid conflicts with the installed `supabase` library.
- Moved `conftest.py` from the project root to the `tests/` directory and updated import paths accordingly.
- Verified all changes by running the test suite after each fix; all tests now pass successfully.
- Cleaned up obsolete files (removed root `conftest.py`).

**Takeaway:**
Maintaining a clean Python package structure and avoiding naming conflicts is essential for reliable test discovery and import resolution. These changes ensure the RAG tooling test suite is robust and maintainable for future development.
