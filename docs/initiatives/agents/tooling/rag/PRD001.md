# Enhanced Context Retrieval RAG Tooling - Product Requirements Document

## Context
This document defines the requirements for enhanced context retrieval tooling that will serve as the foundation for agent-based insurance document analysis within the Insurance Navigator platform. This PRD follows the documentation generation framework established in the project and serves as the first of three interconnected documents (PRD001 → RFC001 → TODO001).

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
Basic vector similarity search (top-k retrieval) provides insufficient context for complex insurance, legal, and regulatory document analysis. Agents performing specialized tasks require richer document context that goes beyond simple semantic matching to include related provisions, dependent clauses, and comprehensive regulatory frameworks.

### Impact on Agent Performance
- **Strategy agents** cannot access complete service eligibility pathways and alternative access routes
- **Regulatory agents** miss implementation guidelines and cross-referenced compliance requirements  
- **Form-filling agents** lack comprehensive field instructions and dependent field relationships
- **Information retrieval agents** provide incomplete answers due to limited document context

## Success Metrics

### Quantifiable Outcomes
- **Context Completeness**: 80% improvement in relevant context retrieval vs. basic top-k search
- **Agent Accuracy**: 25% improvement in agent response accuracy with enhanced context
- **Retrieval Performance**: <200ms average response time for enhanced context retrieval
- **Token Efficiency**: Maintain context expansion within configurable token budgets

### Key Performance Indicators  
- Reduced follow-up queries due to incomplete initial context
- Improved agent confidence scores in document analysis tasks
- Decreased manual context validation requirements
- Enhanced coverage of regulatory dependencies and cross-references

## User Stories

### Strategy Agent Integration
- Strategy agents retrieve eligibility requirements with expanded context that includes related requirements, exceptions, and alternative pathways
- The tooling provides comprehensive service access information beyond initial query matches
- Strategy agents can identify complete pathways to services including prerequisite documentation and alternative access routes

### Regulatory Agent Integration  
- Regulatory agents find specific regulations with expanded context including implementation guidelines, related statutes, and compliance requirements
- The tooling captures comprehensive regulatory frameworks for thorough compliance analysis
- Regulatory agents can assess strategy feasibility by accessing complete regulatory context and dependencies

### Form-Filling Agent Integration
- Form-filling agents search by field numbers/titles with expanded context including instructions, examples, validation rules, and related field information
- The tooling provides complete form guidance context for accurate completion
- Form-filling agents can identify field dependencies and conditional logic through enhanced context retrieval

### Developer Integration
- Developers integrate enhanced retrieval through a simple API without understanding complex expansion logic
- The tooling provides configurable context expansion strategies suitable for different agent use cases
- Developers can customize retrieval behavior based on specific agent requirements and use case constraints

## Functional Requirements

### Core Retrieval API
- **Primary Function**: `retrieve_chunks(query: str, user_id: UUID, config: RetrievalConfig) -> List[ChunkWithContext]`
- **Vector Similarity Search**: Utilize existing `document_chunks.embedding` field for initial semantic matching
- **User-Scoped Access**: Ensure `documents.owner = user_id` for multi-tenant security
- **Token Budget Management**: Configurable limits to control context size and API costs
- **Context Expansion**: Intelligent expansion beyond basic top-k results using document metadata

### Configuration Management
- **Retrieval Parameters**: Configurable similarity thresholds, maximum chunk counts, and expansion strategies
- **Agent-Specific Configs**: Predefined configurations optimized for different agent types
- **Token Budgeting**: Flexible token allocation with priority-based context inclusion
- **Performance Tuning**: Adjustable parameters for balancing completeness vs. response time

### Data Integration
- **Existing Schema Compatibility**: Work with current Supabase `document_chunks` table structure
- **Metadata Utilization**: Leverage `section_path`, `section_title`, `page_start/end`, `chunk_index` fields
- **Document Relationships**: Utilize `doc_id` foreign key relationships for document-level context
- **Embedding Reuse**: Build on existing OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536 dimensions)

### Response Format
- **Structured Output**: Return chunks with metadata, relevance scores, and expansion reasoning
- **Source Attribution**: Maintain document source paths and chunk locations for transparency
- **Context Hierarchy**: Indicate primary matches vs. expanded context for agent decision-making
- **Performance Metadata**: Include retrieval timing and token usage for optimization

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: <200ms for retrieval with context expansion (95th percentile)
- **Throughput**: Support concurrent agent requests without performance degradation
- **Scalability**: Handle document collections up to 10,000 chunks per user without linear performance decline
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimize memory footprint during context expansion operations

### Security & Compliance
- **User Isolation**: Strict enforcement of user-scoped document access
- **Data Encryption**: Maintain compatibility with planned vector encryption features
- **Audit Logging**: Track retrieval patterns for compliance and debugging
- **Access Control**: Support for future role-based access control implementation

### Reliability & Maintainability
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation to basic top-k search when expansion fails
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging for retrieval decisions and performance monitoring
- **Testing Coverage**: Unit and integration tests for all retrieval strategies
- **Configuration Validation**: Input validation and error messaging for configuration parameters

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Multi-modal document support**: Extension to handle images, tables, and complex document formats

## Next Steps

This PRD will serve as the foundation for the subsequent RFC001 (Request for Comments) document, which will define the technical architecture and implementation approach for enhanced context retrieval. The RFC001 will address specific expansion strategies, API design, and integration patterns based on the requirements established in this document.

Following the RFC001, a detailed TODO001 document will break down the implementation into specific, actionable development tasks for the enhanced context retrieval RAG tooling system.
