# Future Retrieval Strategies - Research & Experimentation Plan

## Context

This document outlines future retrieval strategies to be implemented and compared after the MVP RAG system is operational. The MVP serves as a control baseline using standard vector similarity search, enabling comparative analysis of enhanced retrieval approaches.

## Experimental Retrieval Strategies

### 1. Cascading Context Retrieval
**Approach**: Start with initial semantic matches, then expand context by retrieving related chunks based on document structure and metadata.

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Initial vector similarity search (top-k)
- Expand to include adjacent chunks within same section
- Add related sections based on `section_path` hierarchy
- Include cross-referenced content based on document relationships

**Expected Benefits**:
- More comprehensive context for complex legal/regulatory documents
- Better coverage of dependent clauses and related provisions
- Improved understanding of document structure and relationships

**Metrics to Track**:
- Context completeness vs. MVP baseline
- Response accuracy improvement
- Token efficiency (context quality per token used)
- Response time impact

### 2. Recursive Context Retrieval
**Approach**: Iteratively refine and expand search results through multiple rounds of similarity matching.

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Initial vector similarity search
- Use initial results to generate refined queries
- Perform secondary searches with expanded query context
- Merge and deduplicate results across iterations
- Apply intelligent stopping criteria

**Expected Benefits**:
- Discovery of indirectly related content
- Better handling of complex multi-faceted queries
- Improved recall for comprehensive document analysis

**Metrics to Track**:
- Recall improvement vs. single-pass approaches
- Query refinement effectiveness
- Computational efficiency vs. accuracy trade-offs
- User satisfaction with result comprehensiveness

### 3. Hybrid Keyword-Semantic Retrieval
**Approach**: Combine traditional keyword matching with vector similarity for improved precision and recall.

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Parallel keyword extraction and semantic embedding
- Weighted combination of keyword and semantic scores
- Dynamic weighting based on query characteristics
- Fallback strategies for edge cases

**Expected Benefits**:
- Better handling of specific terms, regulations, and form numbers
- Improved precision for exact match requirements
- Robust performance across diverse query types

**Metrics to Track**:
- Precision/recall vs. semantic-only approach
- Performance on specific term queries
- Effectiveness of scoring combination strategies

### 4. Multi-Modal Document Retrieval
**Approach**: Extend retrieval to include document structure, formatting, and metadata as additional signals.

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Incorporate document formatting and structure embeddings
- Use page layout and visual hierarchy as retrieval signals
- Combine text content with document metadata
- Consider table, list, and section formatting in matching

**Expected Benefits**:
- Better understanding of document context and importance
- Improved retrieval for structured content (forms, regulations)
- Enhanced handling of complex document layouts

### 5. Agent-Adaptive Retrieval
**Approach**: Customize retrieval strategies based on agent type and historical performance.

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Agent-specific retrieval parameter optimization
- Learning from agent feedback and success patterns
- Dynamic strategy selection based on query characteristics
- Personalized expansion and filtering approaches

**Expected Benefits**:
- Optimized performance for specific agent use cases
- Continuous improvement through usage patterns
- Reduced need for manual configuration tuning

## Experimental Framework

### Comparison Methodology
1. **Control Baseline**: MVP RAG with standard vector similarity

3. **Evaluation Metrics**: 
   - Response time (<200ms target)
   - Context relevance scores
   - Agent accuracy improvements
   - Token efficiency
   - User satisfaction ratings

### Data Collection
- Query patterns and characteristics
- Retrieval result quality assessments
- Agent performance correlations
- User feedback and satisfaction scores
- System performance and resource usage

### Success Criteria
Each strategy must demonstrate:
- Measurable improvement over MVP baseline
- Acceptable performance characteristics (<200ms)
- Practical implementation complexity
- Clear use case advantages

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Post-MVP): Foundational Experiments
1. **Cascading Context Retrieval** - Most aligned with original vision
2. **Hybrid Keyword-Semantic** - Addresses specific term matching needs

### Phase 2: Advanced Techniques
3. **Recursive Context Retrieval** - Complex but potentially high-impact
4. **Multi-Modal Document Retrieval** - Infrastructure-dependent

### Phase 3: Adaptive Systems
5. **Agent-Adaptive Retrieval** - Requires significant usage data

## Research Questions

### Technical Questions
- What is the optimal balance between retrieval comprehensiveness and response time?
- How do different strategies perform across various document types (legal, regulatory, forms)?
- What are the token efficiency trade-offs for different expansion approaches?

### Product Questions
- Which retrieval strategies provide the most value for specific agent types?
- How do users perceive the quality differences between strategies?
- What configuration complexity is acceptable for agent developers?

### Performance Questions
- What are the scalability characteristics of each approach?
- How do strategies perform under concurrent agent usage?
- What caching and optimization opportunities exist?

## Next Steps

1. **Complete MVP Implementation** - Establish baseline system
2. **Define Evaluation Framework** - Metrics, testing methodology, data collection
3. **Implement Cascading Strategy** - First experimental approach
4. **Comparative Analysis** - Document findings and user feedback
5. **Iterate and Expand** - Continue with additional strategies based on results

This experimental approach ensures that enhanced retrieval strategies are grounded in empirical evidence and provide measurable improvements over the simple baseline system.
