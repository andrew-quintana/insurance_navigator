# MVP RAG System - Phase 2 Validation Results

## Test Results
- All unit and integration tests pass, including:
  - Error handling (DB connection, SQL, embedding errors)
  - Edge cases (empty embedding, empty DB, token budget, missing fields)
  - User-scoped access (mocked multi-user)
  - Performance (<200ms retrieval for mocked DB)
  - Resource cleanup (DB connection closed on error)
- Integration test with real Supabase/Postgres passes if DB is available

## Performance Validation
- Mocked DB retrieval: consistently <200ms (measured in test)
- Real DB: integration test passes, performance depends on environment
- No memory/resource leaks observed in tests

## System Reliability
- Error handling: system returns empty result on DB/SQL/embedding errors
- No unhandled exceptions in normal or error scenarios
- Robust to edge cases and invalid input
- DB connection always closed (resource cleanup validated)

## Production Readiness
- System is reliable and robust for MVP baseline
- Ready for use as control in future retrieval strategy experiments

## Next Steps
- Document performance benchmarks and agent integration best practices
- Finalize API documentation for agent developers
