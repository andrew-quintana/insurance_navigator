# Enhanced Context Retrieval RAG Tooling - MVP Implementation TODO

## Context

This TODO document provides the MVP implementation breakdown for the Enhanced Context Retrieval RAG Tooling system, building upon the requirements established in [PRD001.md](./PRD001.md) and the technical architecture defined in [RFC001.md](./RFC001.md). This focuses on a simple, working RAG system that can serve as a baseline for future retrieval strategy comparisons.

**Reference Documents:**
- **PRD001.md**: Requirements for enhanced context retrieval with <200ms response time and basic context improvement
- **RFC001.md**: Plugin-based architecture foundation for future extensibility

**MVP Scope:**
Simple RAG implementation with basic vector similarity search and configurable response limits. This serves as the control baseline for future retrieval strategy experiments (cascading, recursive, etc.) documented in [future-retrieval-strategies.md](./future-retrieval-strategies.md).

## Implementation Plan

This implementation is organized into two focused phases for rapid MVP delivery.

### Context for Claude
**IMPORTANT**: This is a new session for MVP RAG implementation.

5. **Implement simple RAGTool class**
   - Constructor with user_id and optional config
   - `retrieve_chunks(query: str) -> List[ChunkWithContext]` method
   - Basic vector similarity search using Supabase

   - Token budget enforcement

#### Agent Integration
