# Enhanced Context Retrieval RAG Tooling - MVP Implementation TODO

## Context

This TODO document provides the MVP implementation breakdown for the Enhanced Context Retrieval RAG Tooling system, building upon the requirements established in [PRD001.md](./PRD001.md) and the technical architecture defined in [RFC001.md](./RFC001.md). This focuses on a simple, working RAG system that can serve as a baseline for future retrieval strategy comparisons.

**Reference Documents:**
- **PRD001.md**: Requirements for enhanced context retrieval with <200ms response time and basic context improvement
- **RFC001.md**: Plugin-based architecture foundation for future extensibility

**MVP Scope:**
Simple RAG implementation with basic vector similarity search and configurable response limits. This serves as the control baseline for future retrieval strategy experiments (cascading, recursive, etc.) documented in [future-retrieval-strategies.md](./future-retrieval-strategies.md).

## Implementation Plan

This implementation is organized into two focused phases for rapid MVP delivery.

### Context for Claude
**IMPORTANT**: This is a new session for MVP RAG implementation.

You are implementing a simple RAG system for insurance document analysis agents. This MVP focuses on basic vector similarity search with configurable limits, serving as a control baseline for future retrieval strategy experiments.

**MVP Components:**
- Simple `RAGTool` class with basic vector similarity search
- `RetrievalConfig` for configurable parameters (similarity_threshold, max_chunks, token_budget)
- `ChunkWithContext` data structure for results
- Basic Supabase integration for vector search
- Simple agent integration pattern

**Performance Requirements:**
- <200ms response time for basic retrieval
- User-scoped document access for multi-tenant security
- Configurable result limits for token budget management

### Tasks

   - Initialize configuration module

2. **Database integration**
   - Review existing Supabase `document_chunks` schema
   - Create database connection utilities for vector search
   - Test basic vector similarity queries

#### Core Implementation
3. **Implement RetrievalConfig class**

   - Source attribution (doc_id, chunk_index, page info)
   - Relevance scoring from vector similarity

5. **Implement simple RAGTool class**
   - Constructor with user_id and optional config
   - `retrieve_chunks(query: str) -> List[ChunkWithContext]` method
   - Basic vector similarity search using Supabase
   - User-scoped access control (`documents.owner = user_id`)
   - Token budget enforcement

#### Agent Integration
6. **Create agent integration pattern**
   - Simple property pattern for BaseAgent integration
   - Agent-specific configuration example
   - Clean integration with existing agent patterns

#### Testing
7. **Basic test implementation**
