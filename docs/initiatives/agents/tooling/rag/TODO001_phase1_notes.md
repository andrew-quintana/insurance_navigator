# MVP RAG System - Phase 1 Implementation Notes

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the MVP Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for insurance document analysis agents. The MVP serves as a baseline for future retrieval strategy experiments.

## Implementation Steps
- Created `agents/tooling/rag/` directory structure
- Implemented `RetrievalConfig` dataclass for retrieval parameters
- Implemented `ChunkWithContext` dataclass for chunk results with metadata
- Implemented `RAGTool` class for vector similarity search with user-scoped access and token budget enforcement
- Used asyncpg for direct, efficient vector search against the Supabase/Postgres database
- Enforced user-scoped access (`documents.owner = user_id`)
- Designed for easy property-based lazy initialization in agents
- Added unit tests for all core components with DB mocking

## Key Points
- Focused on simplicity, performance (<200ms), and security (user isolation)
- All tests pass, confirming correct baseline behavior
- Ready for extension with advanced retrieval strategies in future phases
