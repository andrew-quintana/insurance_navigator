# MVP RAG System - Phase 1 Handoff Notes

## Issues/Blockers
- None blocking for core MVP; all tests pass and baseline is functional
- Integration with real Supabase DB should be validated in staging before production use
- Ensure environment variables for DB connection are set in all environments

## Prerequisites for Phase 2
- Complete end-to-end integration tests with real data
- Add analytics, logging, and performance monitoring hooks
- Prepare documentation for agent integration and API usage

## Integration Test Coverage
- Integration test with real Supabase/Postgres is present and passing.
- Future phases should maintain and extend integration test coverage as new retrieval strategies and features are added.

## Notes for Next Phase
- Future work will add plugin/expander architecture and advanced retrieval strategies
- Maintain test coverage as new features are added
- Use this MVP as the control for all future retrieval experiments
