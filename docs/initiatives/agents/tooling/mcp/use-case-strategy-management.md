ðŸ§­ Strategy Management with MCP

Overview

This module enables real-time and retrospective management of AI decision-making strategies via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides a structured interface for storing, evolving, and evaluating strategies used by agentic AI systems, particularly in regulated or high-stakes domains like insurance, legal assistance, and benefits navigation.

Use Case

ðŸ“Œ Goal

Enable curators (e.g. internal staff, policy domain experts, pilot operators) to:
	â€¢	View usage statistics for strategies applied by AI agents
	â€¢	Edit and evolve strategies over time
	â€¢	Track performance, feedback, and confidence signals
	â€¢	Curate future improvements and test new versions

System Components

1. Strategy Definition (MCP Layer)

Each strategy is stored as a structured object in the MCP, containing:
	â€¢	Unique strategy ID
	â€¢	Target user profiles or personas
	â€¢	RAG configuration (retrievers, documents, chunking, expansion)
	â€¢	Action templates or prompting instructions
	â€¢	Versioning metadata

{
  "id": "copay_reduction_v2",
  "applies_to": ["dual_eligible", "low_income"],
  "retrieval_docs": ["medicare_part_d.pdf", "ssa_form_1020.pdf"],
  "action_prompt": "Recommend copay subsidy options based on retrieved eligibility rules.",
  "version": 2,
  "created_by": "curator_admin",
  "created_at": "2025-07-01"
}

2. Strategy Log (Telemetry)

Each time a strategy is applied, the agent logs:
	â€¢	Strategy ID
	â€¢	User context (anonymized or ID-only)
	â€¢	Timestamp
	â€¢	Agent confidence
	â€¢	Final output or recommended action
	â€¢	Optional intermediate RAG results

{
  "user_id": "user_abc",
  "strategy_id": "copay_reduction_v2",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-24T15:21:00Z",
  "agent_confidence": 0.91,
  "output_action": "Submit SSA-1020 form"
}

3. Performance Feedback (Delayed/Curated)

As user outcomes emerge, internal curators can log:
	â€¢	Success/failure (binary or graded)
	â€¢	Annotated issues (retrieval gap, user mismatch, missing info)
	â€¢	Freeform notes
	â€¢	Suggestions for revision or forking

{
  "strategy_id": "copay_reduction_v2",
  "user_id": "user_abc",
  "reviewer": "policy_team_member_1",
  "outcome": "success",
  "notes": "User followed the suggested steps and obtained assistance.",
  "suggested_changes": "Include info on phone-based assistance programs."
}

Implementation Notes
	â€¢	Storage via Supabase/Postgres (strategies, strategy_logs, strategy_feedback)
	â€¢	Access controlled by Supabase Auth or Clerk (curator-only)
	â€¢	Integrates directly with LangGraph agent logs or LangChain observability stack
	â€¢	Optional: Use RAG fallback when no matching strategy exists, and log those for future curation

Future Extensions
	â€¢	Version control with diffs
	â€¢	Retrieval quality visualization (chunk coverage, document match %)
	â€¢	Experiment framework for A/B testing strategies
	â€¢	Auto-suggest strategy improvements via LLM feedback loop
