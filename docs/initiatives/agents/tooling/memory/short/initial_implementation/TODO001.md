# TODO001.md — Short-Term Chat Memory MVP Implementation

## Context & Reference

This implementation breakdown builds upon the requirements and technical design established in the previous documents:

- **PRD001.md**: Product requirements defining the standalone memory system with manual API triggers
- **RFC001.md**: Technical architecture emphasizing sequential processing and MCP summarizer agent  
- **CONTEXT.md**: Feature scope focusing on chat-specific memory without workflow integration

**Key Deliverables:**
- Manual trigger API endpoint for memory updates
- MCP summarizer agent following base agent pattern  
- Sequential processing step for queue management
- Database schema with `chat_metadata` and `chat_context_queue` tables
- Memory retrieval API for agent access

**Technical Approach:**
- Standalone architecture with no integration points for MVP
- Write-ahead logging pattern using queue table for reliability
- Three-field memory structure (user_confirmed, llm_inferred, general_summary)
- PostgreSQL/Supabase backend with optimized indexing

## Implementation Methodology

This TODO is organized into 4 discrete phases designed for execution in separate Claude Code sessions. Each phase is self-contained and includes all necessary context to operate independently.

**Phase Progression:**
1. **Database Foundation** → Database schema and basic operations
2. **API Infrastructure** → Manual trigger endpoints and validation  
3. **Memory Processing** → MCP agent and sequential processing logic
4. **Integration & Validation** → End-to-end testing and documentation

Each phase produces documentation files that serve as inputs for subsequent phases, enabling clean session separation while maintaining project continuity.
