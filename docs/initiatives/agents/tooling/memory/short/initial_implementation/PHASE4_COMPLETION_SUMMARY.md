## 🔧 Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. Conversation Service Enhancement
- **Issue**: Conversation creation failed due to missing ID field
- **Solution**: Added optional `conversation_id` parameter to `create_conversation()`
- **Result**: Conversations now create successfully with proper UUID handling

### 2. Supabase Client Compatibility
- **Issue**: Response handling incompatible with current Supabase client version
- **Solution**: Updated response handling to work with both old and new client structures
- **Result**: Robust database operations across different client versions

### 3. Memory Processor Integration
- **Issue**: `process_once()` function signature mismatch
- **Solution**: Corrected function calls with proper parameters
- **Result**: Queue processing works seamlessly with MCP agent integration
