**Scope**: End-to-end testing, performance benchmarking, monitoring setup
**Architecture**: Complete standalone memory system with all components integrated
**Validation**: All PRD acceptance criteria and RFC performance requirements

## Validation Requirements

From PRD001.md and RFC001.md, validate these core requirements:

### Performance Benchmarks
- Memory updates complete within 2 seconds (RFC requirement)
- Memory retrieval responds within 100ms (RFC requirement)
- System handles 10,000+ concurrent active chats
- 99.5% memory update success rate achieved

### Acceptance Criteria
- Memory storage works correctly for all three fields
- Manual API endpoint initiates memory updates successfully
- MCP Summarizer Agent operates following base agent pattern
- Sequential processing handles queue entries correctly
- System handles edge cases (failures, size limits, etc.)
- Memory summaries accurately reflect different information types

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Environment Setup
- Set up testing environment that mirrors production
- Configure load testing tools and scripts
- Set up monitoring and observability infrastructure
- Prepare test data sets for various scenarios

### 2. End-to-End Integration Testing
- **Complete Memory Update Flow**:
  - API trigger creates queue entry successfully
  - Queue processing invokes MCP agent correctly
  - MCP agent generates valid three-field summaries
  - Database updates complete successfully
  - Memory retrieval returns accurate data

- **Memory Continuity Testing**:
  - Multiple updates preserve and build upon prior memory
  - Three fields (user_confirmed, llm_inferred, general_summary) update correctly
  - Token counting and size limits work as expected
  - Historical context maintains accuracy over time

- **Error Scenario Testing**:
  - API validation errors handled gracefully
  - MCP agent timeouts and failures handled properly
  - Database connection errors don't corrupt data
  - Queue processing recovers from failures
  - System degrades gracefully under load

### 3. Performance & Load Testing
- **Benchmark Core Performance Requirements**:
  - Memory updates complete within 2 seconds (target from RFC)
  - Memory retrieval responds within 100ms (target from RFC)
  - API endpoints handle expected request volumes
  - Database queries perform within acceptable limits

- **Load Testing with Concurrent Operations**:
  - 1,000+ concurrent memory update requests
  - 10,000+ stored memories without performance degradation
  - Concurrent API access and queue processing
  - Database performance under high concurrent load

- **Scalability Validation**:
  - Memory isolation between different chats
  - Queue processing scales with volume
  - Database indexing effectiveness at scale
  - MCP agent resource utilization and limits

### 4. Reliability & Error Handling Testing
- **Test Retry Mechanisms**:
  - Failed MCP agent invocations retry successfully
  - Database failures trigger appropriate retries
  - Queue processing continues after errors
  - Circuit breaker patterns activate correctly

- **Test Data Consistency**:
  - Partial failures don't corrupt memory data
  - Queue entries maintain consistency across failures
  - Database transactions handle edge cases properly
  - Memory updates are atomic and consistent

- **Validate Success Rate Requirements**:
  - Achieve 99.5% memory update success rate (target from PRD)
  - Measure and document actual success rates
  - Identify and fix primary failure modes
  - Validate error reporting and alerting

### 5. Production Readiness Implementation
- **Monitoring & Observability**:
  - Implement key metrics dashboard:
    - Memory update success rate
    - Queue processing time and depth
    - Memory retrieval latency
    - API usage and error rates
  - Configure alerting thresholds:
    - Queue depth >100 entries for >5 minutes
    - Success rate <99% over 15 minutes
    - Retrieval latency >200ms average over 5 minutes
    - API error rate >5% over 10 minutes
  - Create operational runbooks:
    - Common troubleshooting scenarios
    - Performance issue investigation procedures
    - Data recovery procedures
    - System maintenance procedures

- **Security Validation**:
  - Test authentication across all endpoints
  - Validate rate limiting effectiveness (100 req/min per user)
  - Test input sanitization and validation
  - Verify audit logging completeness
  - Test data privacy and access controls

- **Documentation Completion**:
  - Create comprehensive deployment guide
  - Document API integration examples for agents
  - Write operational maintenance procedures
  - Create troubleshooting and debugging guides
  - Finalize configuration and environment documentation

### 6. Final Validation Against Requirements
