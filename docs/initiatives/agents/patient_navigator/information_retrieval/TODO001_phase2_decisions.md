# Phase 2 Architectural Decisions - Information Retrieval Agent

## Overview
This document records the key architectural decisions made during Phase 2 implementation of the Information Retrieval Agent, focusing on LLM-based translation, ReAct pattern implementation, and self-consistency methodology.

## Decision 1: LLM-Based Query Reframing

### Decision
Use LLM for expert query reframing instead of static dictionary-based translation.

### Rationale
- **Flexibility**: LLM can handle complex queries, context, and nuanced language
- **Maintainability**: No need to maintain large terminology dictionaries
- **Quality**: LLM provides more sophisticated and context-aware translations
- **Scalability**: Easy to improve with better prompts and fine-tuning
- **Adaptability**: Can handle new insurance terms and evolving language

### Implementation
```python
async def _reframe_query(self, user_query: str) -> str:
    expert_prompt = f"""
    {system_prompt}
    
    Please reframe the following user query into expert insurance terminology:
    User Query: "{user_query}"
    
    Instructions:
    1. Convert to professional insurance terminology
    2. Use terms from insurance documents
    3. Maintain original intent
    4. Provide ONLY the expert reframe
    """
    
    response = await self._call_llm(expert_prompt)
    return response.strip()
```

### Alternatives Considered
- **Static Dictionary**: Large keyword mapping with context rules
- **Rule-Based Engine**: Complex rule system for translation
- **Hybrid Approach**: Dictionary + LLM for complex cases
- **External Translation Service**: Dedicated microservice

### Impact
- ✅ Improved translation quality and flexibility
- ✅ Reduced maintenance overhead
- ✅ Better handling of complex queries
- ✅ Easy to improve with prompt engineering

## Decision 2: ReAct Pattern Implementation

### Decision
Implement structured step-by-step processing following the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern.

### Rationale
- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into agent reasoning process
- **Debuggability**: Each step can be monitored and validated independently
- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify individual steps without affecting others
- **Quality Control**: Explicit validation points for each processing stage
- **Iterative Improvement**: Loop-based self-consistency with early termination

### Implementation
```python
async def retrieve_information(self, input_data: InformationRetrievalInput) -> InformationRetrievalOutput:
    # Step 1: Parse Structured Input from supervisor workflow
    user_query = input_data.user_query
    user_id = input_data.user_id
    
    # Step 2: Query Reframing using insurance terminology
    expert_query = await self._reframe_query(user_query)
    
    # Step 3: RAG Integration with existing system
    chunks = await self._retrieve_chunks(expert_query, user_id)
    
    # Step 4-N: Self-Consistency Loop (3-5 iterations)
    response_variants = await self._generate_response_variants(chunks, user_query, expert_query)
    consistency_score = self.consistency_checker.calculate_consistency(response_variants)
    
    # Final: Structured Output generation
    final_response = self.consistency_checker.synthesize_final_response(response_variants, consistency_score)
    return InformationRetrievalOutput(...)
```

### Alternatives Considered
- **Single Integrated Agent**: Handle all processing internally
- **Pipeline Pattern**: Linear processing without explicit steps
- **Event-Driven**: Event-based processing architecture
- **Microservices**: Separate services for each step

### Impact
- ✅ Clear processing flow and debugging capability
- ✅ Easy to optimize individual steps
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling at each step
- ✅ Transparent processing for users and developers

## Decision 3: Self-Consistency Methodology

### Decision
Use LLM-based variant generation with consistency scoring for response quality assurance.

### Rationale
- **Quality Assurance**: Multiple perspectives improve response accuracy
- **Reliability**: Consistency scoring provides confidence measures
- **Flexibility**: Configurable variant count and quality thresholds
- **Transparency**: Clear confidence scoring for user trust
- **Robustness**: Handles uncertainty and conflicting information

### Implementation
```python
async def _generate_response_variants(self, chunks: List[ChunkWithContext], user_query: str, expert_query: str) -> List[str]:
    variants = []
    for i in range(3):  # Generate 3 variants
        variant_prompt = self._create_variant_prompt(user_query, expert_query, document_context, i+1)
        variant_response = await self._call_llm(variant_prompt)
        cleaned_variant = self._clean_response_variant(variant_response)
        if cleaned_variant:
            variants.append(cleaned_variant)
    return variants
```

### Alternatives Considered
- **Single Response**: Generate only one response
- **Ensemble Methods**: Multiple model responses
- **Human Validation**: Manual review of responses
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Simple confidence scoring

### Impact
- ✅ Improved response quality and reliability
- ✅ Clear confidence measures for users
- ✅ Robust handling of uncertain information
- ✅ Transparent quality assessment

## Decision 4: Simplified Terminology Translator

### Decision
Simplify the terminology translator to focus on validation and fallback functionality.

### Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns**: Main translation handled by LLM
- **Maintainability**: Simpler code with focused responsibility
- **Reliability**: Fallback mechanism for LLM failures
- **Validation**: Quality checks for LLM responses
- **Performance**: Faster validation than complex dictionary lookups

### Implementation
```python
class InsuranceTerminologyTranslator:
    def validate_translation(self, original: str, translated: str) -> bool:
        # Basic validation checks
        if not translated or len(translated.strip()) == 0:
            return False
        
        # Check that translation contains insurance terminology
        has_insurance_terms = any(term in translated.lower() for term in self._insurance_terms)
        return has_insurance_terms
    
    def get_fallback_translation(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Simple keyword replacements for fallback
        translated = query.lower()
        for common, expert in self._common_to_expert.items():
            translated = translated.replace(common, expert)
        return translated
```

### Alternatives Considered
- **Keep Complex Dictionary**: Maintain full terminology mapping
- **Remove Translator**: Rely entirely on LLM
- **External Service**: Dedicated translation service
- **Hybrid Approach**: Dictionary + LLM combination

### Impact
- ✅ Cleaner code architecture
- ✅ Focused responsibility for validation
- ✅ Reliable fallback mechanism
- ✅ Easier maintenance and testing

## Decision 5: MVP Embedding Implementation

### Decision
Use hash-based embedding for MVP with clear path to production embedding service.

### Rationale

- **Compatibility**: Works with existing pgvector database
- **Clear Migration Path**: Easy to replace with real embedding service
- **Testing**: Enables testing without external dependencies
- **Performance**: Predictable performance characteristics

### Implementation
```python
async def _generate_embedding(self, text: str) -> List[float]:
    # Simple hash-based embedding for MVP
    hash_obj = hashlib.md5(text.encode())
    hash_bytes = hash_obj.digest()
    
    # Convert to list of floats (simplified embedding)
    embedding = []
    for i in range(0, len(hash_bytes), 4):
        if i + 4 <= len(hash_bytes):
            float_val = struct.unpack('f', hash_bytes[i:i+4])[0]
            embedding.append(float_val)
    
    # Pad to 384 dimensions (common embedding size)
    while len(embedding) < 384:
        embedding.append(0.0)
    
    return embedding[:384]
```

### Alternatives Considered
- **Real Embedding Service**: Use production embedding API

### Implementation
```python
async def retrieve_information(self, input_data: InformationRetrievalInput) -> InformationRetrievalOutput:
    try:
        # Main processing flow
        expert_query = await self._reframe_query(user_query)
        chunks = await self._retrieve_chunks(expert_query, user_id)
        # ... rest of processing
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Error in information retrieval: {e}")
        return InformationRetrievalOutput(
            expert_reframe="",
            direct_answer="I encountered an error while processing your request. Please try again.",
            key_points=["Error occurred during processing"],
            confidence_score=0.0,
            source_chunks=[],
            error_message=str(e)
        )
```

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_retrieve_information_full_flow(self, agent, sample_input):
    # Mock all the dependencies
    with patch.object(agent, '_reframe_query', new_callable=AsyncMock) as mock_reframe, \
         patch.object(agent, '_retrieve_chunks', new_callable=AsyncMock) as mock_retrieve, \
         patch.object(agent, '_generate_response_variants', new_callable=AsyncMock) as mock_variants:
        
        # Set up mock returns
        mock_reframe.return_value = "outpatient physician services benefit coverage"
        mock_retrieve.return_value = [Mock(), Mock()]
        mock_variants.return_value = ["Response 1", "Response 2", "Response 3"]
        
        # Execute the full flow
        result = await agent.retrieve_information(sample_input)
        
        # Verify the result structure
        assert isinstance(result, InformationRetrievalOutput)
        assert result.expert_reframe == "outpatient physician services benefit coverage"
```
