### Context for Claude

**IMPORTANT**: This is a new session. Use only the inputs provided below, do not rely on prior conversation history.

You are implementing Phase 1 of the Information Retrieval Agent for the Insurance Navigator platform. This agent uses a ReAct pattern to translate user queries into insurance terminology, integrate with existing RAG systems, and provide consistent responses through self-consistency methodology.

- Implement domain-driven organization under `patient_navigator/`
- The agent receives structured input from supervisor workflow (not direct user queries)
