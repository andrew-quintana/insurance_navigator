# Create a query
input_data = InformationRetrievalInput(
    user_query="What's my copay for specialist visits?",

)

# Get the answer
result = await agent.retrieve_information(input_data)

✅ "What's covered for prescription drugs?"
```

#### **Cost Questions**
```

✅ "How much do I pay for specialist consultations?"
✅ "What's the cost for diagnostic tests?"
```

#### **Authorization Questions**
```

```
