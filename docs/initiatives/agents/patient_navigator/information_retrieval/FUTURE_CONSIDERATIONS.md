# Future Considerations: Information Retrieval Agent Optimizations

## Dual-View Semantic Retrieval Enhancement

### ðŸ“Œ Feature: Dual-View Semantic Retrieval for RAG System

**Purpose:**
Improve answer relevance in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system by handling both layperson user questions and technical document phrasing, especially in insurance contexts.

**Core Design:**
- **Dual Embedding Strategy**: Generate embeddings from both the original user query and a domain-reframed query.
- **Query Reframing Module**: Reformulates user questions into technically appropriate queries using few-shot prompting or a fine-tuned model.
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Perform semantic search for both versions; merge and deduplicate top-K results.
- **Reranking Layer**: Use similarity or cross-encoder model to rerank merged results before answer synthesis.
- **Answer Generation**: Final output is synthesized from top-ranked documents, ensuring semantic alignment with retrieved content.

**Benefits:**
- Captures user intent in non-technical language
- Increases document recall by bridging phrasing gap
- Supports explainable and auditable retrieval

**Implementation Priority:** Post-MVP optimization (Version 2.0+)

**Integration Points:**
- Enhance existing RAG integration in FR3
- Extend insurance terminology translation in FR2
- Optimize response generation quality in FR4
