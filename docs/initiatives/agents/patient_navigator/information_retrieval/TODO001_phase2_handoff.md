## Implementation Guidance

### Integration Testing Strategy
```python
# Test with real documents and queries
test_queries = [
    "What does my insurance cover for doctor visits?",
    "How much do I pay for prescription drugs?",
    "Is physical therapy covered under my plan?"
]

# Validate performance metrics
- Response time < 2s
- Translation accuracy > 90%
- Retrieval relevance > 0.7 similarity
- Response consistency > 0.8 agreement
```

### Performance Optimization Points
- **LLM Calls**: Optimize prompts for faster responses
- **Embedding Service**: Replace hash-based with real service
- **Parallel Processing**: Async variant generation
- **Caching**: Response and embedding caching

### Quality Assurance Requirements
