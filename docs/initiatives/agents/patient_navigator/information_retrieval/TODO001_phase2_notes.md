## Key Implementation Decisions

### LLM-Based Translation Approach
**Decision**: Use LLM for expert query reframing instead of static dictionary.

**Rationale**:
- **Flexibility**: LLM can handle complex queries and context
- **Maintainability**: No need to maintain large terminology dictionaries
- **Quality**: LLM provides more sophisticated translations
- **Scalability**: Easy to improve with better prompts

**Implementation**:
- Uses BaseAgent's LLM capabilities
- Structured prompts for insurance terminology
- Validation using simplified terminology translator
- Fallback to keyword translation if LLM fails

### ReAct Pattern Implementation
**Decision**: Implement structured step-by-step processing with clear separation.

**Rationale**:
- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into processing steps
- **Debuggability**: Each step can be monitored independently
- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify individual steps
- **Quality Control**: Validation points at each step

**Implementation**:
- Step 1: Parse structured input
- Step 2: LLM-based query reframing
- Step 3: RAG system integration
- Step 4-N: Self-consistency loop
- Final: Structured output generation

### Self-Consistency Methodology
**Decision**: Use LLM-based variant generation with consistency scoring.

**Rationale**:
- **Quality**: Multiple perspectives improve response quality
- **Reliability**: Consistency scoring provides confidence measures
- **Flexibility**: Can adjust variant count and quality thresholds
- **Transparency**: Clear confidence scoring for users

**Implementation**:
- Generates 3-5 response variants using LLM
- Calculates consistency using sequence matcher
- Synthesizes final response based on consistency
- Provides confidence scoring for transparency

## Technical Implementation Details

### Agent Architecture
```python
class InformationRetrievalAgent(BaseAgent):
    async def retrieve_information(self, input_data: InformationRetrievalInput) -> InformationRetrievalOutput:
        # Step 1: Parse Structured Input
        # Step 2: Query Reframing (LLM-based)
        # Step 3: RAG Integration
        # Step 4-N: Self-Consistency Loop
        # Final: Structured Output
```

### LLM Integration Pattern
```python
async def _reframe_query(self, user_query: str) -> str:
    # Create expert reframing prompt
    expert_prompt = f"""
    {system_prompt}
    
    Please reframe the following user query into expert insurance terminology:
    User Query: "{user_query}"
    
    Instructions:
    1. Convert to professional insurance terminology
    2. Use terms from insurance documents
    3. Maintain original intent
    4. Provide ONLY the expert reframe
    """
    
    response = await self._call_llm(expert_prompt)
    return response.strip()
```

### RAG Integration Pattern
```python
async def _retrieve_chunks(self, expert_query: str, user_id: str) -> List[ChunkWithContext]:
    # Initialize RAG tool
    self.rag_tool = RAGTool(user_id=user_id, config=RetrievalConfig.default())
    
    # Generate embedding and retrieve chunks
    query_embedding = await self._generate_embedding(expert_query)
    chunks = await self.rag_tool.retrieve_chunks(query_embedding)
    
    # Filter by similarity threshold
    filtered_chunks = [chunk for chunk in chunks if chunk.similarity >= 0.7]
    return filtered_chunks
```

### Self-Consistency Pattern
```python
async def _generate_response_variants(self, chunks: List[ChunkWithContext], user_query: str, expert_query: str) -> List[str]:
    variants = []
    for i in range(3):  # Generate 3 variants
        variant_prompt = self._create_variant_prompt(user_query, expert_query, document_context, i+1)
        variant_response = await self._call_llm(variant_prompt)
        cleaned_variant = self._clean_response_variant(variant_response)
        if cleaned_variant:
            variants.append(cleaned_variant)
    return variants
```
