# PRD001: Information Retrieval Agent for Patient Navigator

## Product Overview

### Problem Statement
Insurance navigation requires specialized knowledge that creates barriers for patients seeking coverage information. Users may not be educated on insurance terminology and its structure. Their queries may be indirect, incomplete, or with insufficient information. Current systems make it difficult for people to get access to provide expert-level interpretation and consistent, reliable responses to unique/custom queries.

### Solution Summary
The Information Retrieval Agent will serve as an intelligent intermediary that translates user queries into insurance terminology, leverages the existing RAG system for document retrieval, and provides consistent, accurate responses using self-consistency methodology. This agent will bridge the gap between patient language and insurance expertise.

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Query Translation Accuracy**: >90% accurate insurance terminology mapping
- **RAG Retrieval Relevance**: >0.7 similarity threshold for included chunks
- **Response Consistency**: >0.8 agreement across multiple generated responses
- **Response Time**: <2s total response time including RAG retrieval
- **User Satisfaction**: Measured through response completeness and accuracy ratings

### Secondary Metrics
- **Integration Compatibility**: 100% compatibility with existing BaseAgent patterns
- **Error Rate**: <5% failed queries due to system errors
- **Coverage Rate**: >95% of user queries receive actionable responses
- **Token Efficiency**: Maintain token budget compliance within RAG system limits
