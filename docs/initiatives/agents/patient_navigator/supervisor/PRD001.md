# PRD001: Patient Navigator Supervisor Workflow (MVP)

## Project Context

**Project**: Insurance Navigator Patient Navigator Agent - Supervisor Workflow (MVP)
**Target Users**: Patient Navigator system components, healthcare access workflow routing engine
**Current State**: Patient Navigator has information_retrieval and strategy workflow components but lacks intelligent orchestration and document readiness assessment for routing decisions
**MVP Scope**: Proof of concept implementation demonstrating full supervisor workflow functionality with 2 workflows, designed for extensibility to additional workflows

## Problem Statement (MVP Focus)

The Patient Navigator system currently lacks a sophisticated supervisor layer that can:
1. Intelligently determine which workflows are appropriate for a given user request
2. Verify document availability before routing to resource-intensive workflows
3. Provide deterministic routing decisions based on both workflow appropriateness and document readiness
4. Reduce workflow execution failures due to missing prerequisites

**MVP Goal**: Create a proof of concept that demonstrates complete supervisor orchestration patterns using information_retrieval and strategy workflows, establishing the foundation for scaling to additional workflows.

**Anticipated Issues:**
- **Insufficient Documents**: Workflows may fail when required documents are not available in user storage
- **Misrouted Workflows**: User queries may be incorrectly classified and routed to inappropriate workflows, leading to poor user experience and resource waste

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Workflow Success Rate**: >90% of routed workflows complete successfully without document-related failures
- **Routing Accuracy**: >95% accuracy in workflow prescription matching user intent
- **Document Readiness Assessment**: <500ms average response time for document availability checks
- **Resource Efficiency**: 40% reduction in failed workflow executions due to missing prerequisites
