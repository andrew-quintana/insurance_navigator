# Phase 3: Isolated Component Testing - Implementation Prompt

**Context**: Implement Phase 3 of Patient Navigator Supervisor Workflow MVP - comprehensive isolated testing for each component.

## Required Reading
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001_phase2_notes.md`
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001_phase2_decisions.md`
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001_phase2_handoff.md`
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001.md` (Phase 3 section)
- Completed supervisor implementation from Phase 2
- Existing test patterns in patient navigator components

## Objective
Create comprehensive isolated testing for:
- WorkflowPrescriptionAgent with various query patterns and confidence scoring
- DocumentAvailabilityChecker with different availability scenarios
- SupervisorWorkflowAgent orchestration logic and error handling
- Performance testing for individual components

## Key Requirements
- Unit tests for all components with mock dependencies
- Test various workflow prescription scenarios and confidence scores
- Test document availability checking with different user/document combinations
- Performance testing to validate <2 second and <500ms requirements
- Mock-based testing to isolate component behavior

## Expected Outputs
Save phase completion documentation:
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001_phase3_notes.md`
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001_phase3_decisions.md`
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001_phase3_handoff.md`

## Success Criteria
- All Phase 3 checklist items completed
- All unit tests pass consistently
- Performance requirements validated for individual components
- Test coverage adequate for all core functionality
- Component issues documented and resolved
