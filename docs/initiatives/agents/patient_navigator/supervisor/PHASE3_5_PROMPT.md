# Phase 3.5: Complete LangGraph Architecture Implementation - Implementation Prompt

**Context**: Implement Phase 3.5 of Patient Navigator Supervisor Workflow MVP - complete any missing LangGraph architecture implementation from Phases 1-3.

## Required Reading
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001_phase3_notes.md`
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001_phase3_decisions.md`
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001_phase3_handoff.md`
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001.md` (Phase 3.5 section)
- Implemented components from Phases 1-3
- Any incomplete LangGraph workflow architecture components from previous phases

## Objective
Complete any missing LangGraph architecture implementation before system integration:
- Complete any missing LangGraph workflow architecture from Phases 1-3
- Ensure all LangGraph node implementations are complete and tested individually
- Finalize SupervisorState model and workflow node methods
- Complete any missing mock implementations and basic workflow composition

## Key Requirements
- Complete SupervisorWorkflow class with LangGraph StateGraph implementation
- Finalize SupervisorState model and all LangGraph node method implementations
- Complete individual LangGraph component testing that may have been missed
- Ensure LangGraph StateGraph compiles and basic workflow execution works
- Complete missing mock implementations for all LangGraph components

## Expected Outputs
Save phase completion documentation:
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001_phase3_5_notes.md`
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001_phase3_5_decisions.md`
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001_phase3_5_handoff.md`

## Success Criteria
- All Phase 3.5 checklist items completed
- LangGraph StateGraph compiles without errors
- All LangGraph node methods are implemented and tested individually
- SupervisorState model works with LangGraph state management
- Basic workflow execution works with placeholder logic
- Mock mode functionality works for all LangGraph components
- Architecture is ready for system integration in Phase 4
