# Phase 3.5: LangGraph Workflow Integration & Node Composition - Implementation Prompt

**Context**: Implement Phase 3.5 of Patient Navigator Supervisor Workflow MVP - LangGraph workflow integration and node composition before full system testing.

## Required Reading
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001_phase3_notes.md`
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001_phase3_decisions.md`
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001_phase3_handoff.md`
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001.md` (Phase 3.5 section)
- Tested individual components from Phase 3
- LangGraph workflow structure from Phase 1
- Workflow execution node implementations from Phase 2

## Objective
Complete LangGraph workflow integration and validate workflow orchestration:
- Integrate all workflow nodes into complete LangGraph StateGraph
- Test end-to-end LangGraph workflow execution with mocked external dependencies
- Validate workflow state management and node transitions
- Prepare for full system integration with real workflow components in Phase 4

## Key Requirements
- Complete LangGraph StateGraph composition with all workflow nodes
- Implement workflow execution nodes for external workflow integration
- Test complete workflow orchestration flow with mocked dependencies
- Validate workflow state persistence and recovery across node boundaries
- Optimize workflow node performance and transitions for <2 second execution target
- Prepare interfaces for real workflow integration in Phase 4

## Expected Outputs
Save phase completion documentation:
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001_phase3_5_notes.md`
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001_phase3_5_decisions.md`
- `@docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/supervisor/TODO001_phase3_5_handoff.md`

## Success Criteria
- All Phase 3.5 checklist items completed
- Complete LangGraph workflow executes end-to-end with mocked dependencies
- All workflow nodes integrate properly with validated state transitions
- Workflow state management works correctly across all node boundaries
- Performance optimization meets targets for workflow orchestration
- Integration interfaces prepared and validated for Phase 4 system testing
