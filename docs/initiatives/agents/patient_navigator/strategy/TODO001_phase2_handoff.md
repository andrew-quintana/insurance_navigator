## Integration Issues for Phase 3

### 1. LangGraph Workflow Orchestration

**Issue**: Need to integrate 4 components into sequential LangGraph workflow
**Impact**: Medium
**Solution**: Create workflow orchestrator with state management between components

**Technical Details**:
- StrategyMCP (tool) â†’ StrategyCreator (agent) â†’ RegulatoryAgent (agent) â†’ StrategyMemoryLite (agent)
- State management for data flow between components
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Performance monitoring for <30 second total workflow

**Files to Create**:
- `agents/patient_navigator/strategy/workflow/orchestrator.py`
- `agents/patient_navigator/strategy/workflow/models.py`
- `agents/patient_navigator/strategy/workflow/tests/`

### 2. Component Interface Standardization

**Issue**: Need to ensure consistent input/output interfaces between components
**Impact**: Low
**Solution**: Standardize data flow and error handling patterns

**Technical Details**:
- StrategyMCP output â†’ StrategyCreator input
- StrategyCreator output â†’ RegulatoryAgent input
- RegulatoryAgent output â†’ StrategyMemoryLite input
- Consistent error handling and logging patterns

### 3. Dual Scoring System Integration

**Issue**: Ensure dual scoring flows correctly through entire workflow
**Impact**: High
**Solution**: Verify LLM scores generated and stored, human scores updated properly

**Technical Details**:
- LLM scores: StrategyCreator â†’ StrategyMemoryLite (during creation)
- Human scores: User feedback â†’ StrategyMemoryLite (after usage)
- Score validation and range checking throughout workflow
- Database schema compliance verification

### 4. External Service Dependencies

**Issue**: Web search APIs and embedding generation need real implementations
**Impact**: Medium
**Solution**: Replace mock implementations with actual API calls

**Technical Details**:
- Google/Bing/DuckDuckGo API integration for web search
- OpenAI API integration for embedding generation
- Rate limiting and error handling for external services
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation

### 5. Database Connection Management

**Issue**: Supabase client sharing between components
**Impact**: Low
**Solution**: Centralized database connection management

**Technical Details**:
- Shared Supabase client across workflow components
- Connection pooling and error handling
- Transaction management for multi-table operations
- Performance monitoring for database operations

## Phase 3 Preparation Requirements
