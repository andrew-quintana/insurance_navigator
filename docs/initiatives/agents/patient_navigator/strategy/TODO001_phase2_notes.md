- Mock support for testing
- Process method for compatibility
- Error handling and logging

### RAGTool Pattern (StrategyMCP)

- Async database operations
- Error handling with graceful degradation
- Caching and performance optimization

### Information Retrieval Pattern (Agents)

## Dual Scoring System Implementation

### LLM Scores (0.0-1.0 Range)
**Purpose**: StrategyCreator-generated optimization scores
- Generated during strategy creation via LLM self-assessment
- Stored in strategies.strategies table during creation
- Used for semantic retrieval and optimization queries
- Confidence-based scoring aligns with LLM uncertainty

### Human Scores (1.0-5.0 Range)
**Purpose**: User feedback and effectiveness ratings
- Updated via user feedback after strategy usage
- Separate from LLM scores to avoid confusion
- Enables user feedback aggregation and trend analysis
- Familiar 1.0-5.0 range for user ratings

### Storage Pattern
- **Creation**: LLM scores stored, human scores initially NULL
- **Feedback**: Human scores updated, LLM scores remain unchanged
- **Retrieval**: Both score types available for similarity search
- **Performance**: Embedded scoring fields avoid complex JOINs

## Performance Considerations

- Clear separation prevents confusion
- LLM scores are confidence-based (0.0-1.0)
- Human scores are effectiveness-based (1.0-5.0)
- Enables proper validation and user feedback

### MVP 2-Table Architecture
**Decision**: Used strategies.strategies + strategies.strategy_vectors vs complex multi-table
**Rationale**:
- Simplified schema (2 tables vs 8+ tables)
- Performance separation (vector vs metadata queries)
- Easy extension with embedded scoring fields
- Established patterns from documents.* schema

### Direct Supabase SDK Integration
**Decision**: Direct SDK calls vs Edge Functions
**Rationale**:
- Eliminates Edge Function latency
