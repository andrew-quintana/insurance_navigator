# TODO001: Strategy Evaluation & Validation System - Implementation Breakdown

## Document Context
This TODO provides the complete implementation breakdown for the Strategy Evaluation & Validation System based on requirements from PRD001.md and technical architecture from RFC001.md. The implementation is organized into phases designed for execution in separate Claude Code sessions.

**Reference Documents:**
- PRD file: docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/strategy/PRD001.md - Requirements and acceptance criteria
- RFC file: docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/strategy/RFC001.md - Technical architecture and LangGraph orchestration design
- Key deliverables: StrategyMCP (tooling), StrategyCreator Agent, RegulatoryAgent, StrategyMemoryLite with direct Supabase integration
- Technical approach: LangGraph workflow orchestration with component-based testing and direct Supabase SDK calls following established architecture patterns
- Architecture patterns: Follow agents/patient_navigator/information_retrieval/ for agents and agents/tooling/rag/ for MCP tooling

## Phase 1: Environment Setup & Database Foundation

  - @docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/strategy/RFC001.md
  - Package.json (for existing dependencies)
  - Supabase configuration files
- Session setup: Run `/clear` to start fresh

### Context for Claude
**IMPORTANT**: This is a new session. The Strategy Evaluation & Validation System requires LangGraph orchestration with 4 core components: StrategyMCP (plan metadata processor), StrategyCreator (multi-objective optimization agent), RegulatoryAgent (ReAct pattern validator), and StrategyMemoryLite (vector store + metadata storage via direct Supabase SDK). The system generates healthcare access strategies in <30 seconds with component-based testing approach.

### Tasks

3. **Set up vector store dependencies**
   - Confirm pgvector extension enabled in Supabase PostgreSQL
   - Install vector embedding libraries (OpenAI SDK or similar)

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE strategies.strategies (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     title TEXT NOT NULL,
     category TEXT NOT NULL,
     markdown TEXT NOT NULL,
     author_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),

     strategy_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES strategies.strategies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     embedding VECTOR(1536), -- Following existing pgvector pattern
     model_version TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'text-embedding-3-small',
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

## Next Steps

This TODO completes the implementation breakdown for the Strategy Evaluation & Validation System. Upon completion of all phases, the system will provide:

- **Real-time healthcare strategy generation** in under 30 seconds
- **Component-based architecture** with individual testing capabilities  
- **LangGraph workflow orchestration** with error handling and monitoring
- **Direct Supabase integration** for optimal performance
- **Human validation processes** for quality assurance and compliance
- **Production-ready deployment** with security and monitoring

**Post-Implementation Actions:**
1. Monitor system performance against KPIs from PRD001.md
2. Collect user feedback for iterative improvements
3. Plan Phase 2 features from ROADMAP001.md (modular orchestration)
4. Evaluate expansion to additional healthcare domains
