- Debug mode with detailed logging
- System status monitoring

## Performance Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Parallel Processing
- Concurrent service health checks during initialization
- Async/await throughout the entire pipeline
- Non-blocking voice capture and processing
- Connection pooling for API requests

### 2. Caching Strategy
- Multi-level caching (session + persistence)
- Cache warming for common insurance terminology
- Intelligent cache eviction policies
- Provider-specific cache keys

### 3. Resource Management
- Memory usage monitoring and cleanup
- Connection pooling and keep-alive
- Resource leak prevention
- Timeout handling for all operations

## Fallback System Architecture

### Provider Priority Chain
1. **ElevenLabs** (Primary)
   - High quality translation
   - Higher cost ($0.0001 per character)
   - Best for complex insurance terminology

2. **Flash v2.5** (Fallback)
   - Good quality translation
   - Lower cost ($0.00005 per character)
   - Cost-optimized for common languages

3. **Mock Provider** (Emergency)
   - Basic functionality
   - No cost
   - Ensures system availability

### Fallback Triggers
- API failures (HTTP errors, timeouts)
- Circuit breaker activation
- Low confidence scores (< 0.5)
- Performance degradation (> 5s latency)

### Cost Optimization Logic
- Text complexity analysis for quality selection
- Language-specific routing decisions
- User preference consideration
- Real-time cost tracking and reporting

## Error Handling & Resilience

### Circuit Breaker Configuration
- **Router Level**: 10 failures threshold, 120s recovery
- **Provider Level**: 5 failures threshold, 60s recovery
- **Half-Open State**: Limited concurrent requests for testing

### Retry Logic
- Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Maximum 3 retry attempts
- Circuit breaker protection during retries
- Graceful degradation on repeated failures

### Error Categorization
- **Recoverable**: Network timeouts, temporary API issues
- **Non-recoverable**: Authentication failures, invalid requests
- **System**: Resource exhaustion, configuration errors

## Quality Assurance Implementation

### Translation Quality Metrics
- Accuracy scoring based on confidence
- Fluency assessment using text analysis
- Terminology consistency checking
