- ❌ **Cons**: Platform dependencies, system permissions required, setup complexity

**Implementation Details**:
```python
# Silence detection algorithm
while time.time() - start_time < timeout:
    audio_array = np.frombuffer(data, dtype=np.int16)
    volume = np.sqrt(np.mean(audio_array**2))
    
    if volume < silence_threshold:
        silence_duration += chunk_size / sample_rate
        if silence_duration > max_silence and len(frames) > 10:
            break  # End of speech detected
```

### Decision: Real-time Audio Quality Analysis
**Chosen Approach**: Implement comprehensive audio quality scoring with scipy
**Alternative Considered**: Basic file size validation or external quality services

```python
# Custom retry logic with exponential backoff
for attempt in range(self.max_retries):
    try:
        response = await client.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json=request_body)
        if response.status_code == 429:
            wait_time = self.retry_delay * (2 ** attempt)
            await asyncio.sleep(wait_time)
            continue
```

## 3. Caching Implementation Strategy

### Decision: In-Memory LRU Cache with TTL
**Chosen Approach**: Custom OrderedDict-based LRU implementation with time-to-live
**Alternative Considered**: Redis, SQLite, or simple dictionary caching

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: In-memory access provides sub-millisecond lookup times
- **Simplicity**: No external dependencies or infrastructure requirements
- **Development Speed**: Immediate availability without setup complexity
- **Cost**: No additional infrastructure costs

**Cache Design Features**:
```python
class TranslationRouter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache: OrderedDict[str, CacheEntry] = OrderedDict()
        self.cache_hits = 0
        self.cache_misses = 0
    
    def _get_cached_translation(self, cache_key: str) -> Optional[TranslationResult]:
        # TTL validation + LRU ordering + access counting
```

**Trade-offs Considered**:
- ✅ **Pros**: Fast access, no infrastructure, simple deployment
- ❌ **Cons**: Memory usage, no persistence across restarts, single-instance only

### Decision: MD5 Hash Cache Keys
**Chosen Approach**: MD5 hashing of text + language parameters for cache keys
**Alternative Considered**: Direct string concatenation or SHA256 hashing

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: MD5 is faster than SHA256 for non-cryptographic use
- **Memory Efficiency**: Fixed-length keys reduce memory overhead
- **Collision Resistance**: Sufficient for cache key generation (not security-critical)
- **Simplicity**: Built-in Python support without additional dependencies

## 4. Sanitization Engine Strategy

### Decision: LLM-Based Sanitization
**Chosen Approach**: Use LLM for all content sanitization and structuring
**Alternative Considered**: Rule-based processing, deterministic mappings, or hybrid approach

**Rationale**:
- **Intent Preservation**: LLM maintains original user meaning without assumptions
- **Context Awareness**: LLM understands nuanced context better than rules
- **Flexibility**: No need for extensive rule maintenance or domain-specific mappings
- **Quality**: Professional formatting without over-engineering content

**LLM Integration Strategy**:
```python
async def _llm_sanitize(self, text: str, context: UserContext) -> Dict:
    # Create context-aware prompt for LLM
    # Let LLM handle all content decisions
    # No deterministic transformations
    # Preserve original intent completely
```

### Decision: Minimal Technical Cleanup Only
