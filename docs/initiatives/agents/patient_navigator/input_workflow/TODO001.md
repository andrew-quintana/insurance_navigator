# TODO001.md - Input Processing Workflow Implementation

## Project Context and Reference Documents

This TODO implements the **Input Processing Workflow** as defined in:
- **PRD001.md**: Product requirements for multilingual input processing pipeline
- **RFC001.md**: Technical architecture with sequential pipeline design
- **Key Deliverables**: CLI voice/text input → translation → sanitization → downstream handoff
- **Technical Approach**: User-configured language, ElevenLabs/Flash v2.5 integration, graceful fallbacks

## Implementation Methodology

This implementation is organized into **4 discrete phases**, each designed to be executed in separate Claude Code sessions to maintain focus and manageability:

---

## Phase 1: Setup & Foundation

### Prerequisites
- Files/documents to read: `docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/input_workflow/PRD001.md`, `docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/input_workflow/RFC001.md`
- Previous phase outputs: None (initial phase)
- Session setup: Run `/clear` to start fresh

### Context for Claude
**IMPORTANT**: This is a new session. Use only the inputs provided below, do not rely on prior conversation history.

**Project**: Insurance Navigator - Input Processing Workflow MVP
**Goal**: Create foundation for multilingual voice/text input processing with CLI interface
**Architecture**: Sequential pipeline - Input Handler → Translation Router → Sanitization Agent → Integration Layer
**Key Requirements**: 
- <5s latency target, user-configured source language (hardcoded for MVP)
- ElevenLabs v3 primary, Flash v2.5 fallback, CLI testing only
- No persistent storage, session-level caching only

### Tasks

#### Project Structure Setup
1. Create directory structure for input processing workflow in existing `agents/patient_navigator/input_processing/`:
   ```
   agents/patient_navigator/input_processing/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── handler.py
   ├── router.py
   ├── providers/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── elevenlabs.py
   │   └── flash.py
   ├── sanitizer.py
   ├── integration.py
   ├── cli_interface.py
   └── types.py
   ```

2. Set up Python dependencies in existing requirements files
3. Create shared dataclasses and protocols for the workflow pipeline  
4. Initialize basic error handling and logging utilities (integrate with existing logging)

#### Environment Configuration
5. Configure environment variables for API keys (ElevenLabs, Flash) in existing .env files
6. Set up hardcoded Spanish language configuration system for MVP
7. Create basic CLI argument parsing using argparse for voice vs text input modes

9. Create dataclasses for pipeline data flow (TranslationResult, SanitizedOutput, AgentPrompt, UserContext)
10. Implement error types and quality scoring interfaces using Python dataclasses

### Expected Outputs
