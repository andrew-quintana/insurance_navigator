# PRD001.md - Input Processing Workflow

## Project Context
- **Project**: Insurance Navigator - Input Processing Workflow
- **Target Users**: End users interacting with the agentic AI system in multiple languages via text or verbally
- **Current State**: Core multi-agent workflow exists; need preprocessing layer for multilingual input

## Problem Statement

Users need to interact with our agentic AI system naturally in their preferred language, but the downstream agents require clean, structured English input. Current system lacks:

- Voice and text input processing capabilities supporting multiple languages
- Input sanitization and intent clarification
- Seamless handoff to existing multi-agent workflow

This creates friction for non-English speakers and results in poor agent performance due to ambiguous or untranslated input.

## Success Metrics

- **Primary KPIs**:
  - End-to-end latency: <5 seconds per interaction
  - Translation accuracy: >95% for supported languages
  - Intent preservation: User validation >90% for sanitized output
  - System availability: >99.5% uptime

- **Secondary Metrics**:
  - Cost per interaction: <$0.05 (free-tier optimized)
  - Fallback success rate: >85% when primary translation fails

## User Stories

### Primary Users - Multilingual End Users
- **As a Spanish-speaking user**, I want to speak my insurance questions naturally so that I can get help without language barriers
- **As a user with mixed-language input**, I want the system to understand my intent even when I switch between languages mid-sentence
- **As a user with unclear speech**, I want the system to ask for clarification rather than misunderstand my request

### Secondary Users - System Administrators  
- **As a system admin**, I want reliable fallback handling so that translation failures don't break the user experience
- **As a developer**, I want clear error messaging so that I can debug issues in the input processing pipeline

## Functional Requirements

### Core Capabilities
1. **Voice Input Processing**
   - Capture audio from system microphone (CLI interface for MVP)
   - Support common audio formats and quality levels
   - Handle silence detection and input timeout

2. **Text Input Processing**
   - Accept text input as alternative to voice
   - Support UTF-8 encoding for international characters
   - Handle copy-paste and direct typing workflows

3. **Language Translation**
   - Language will be set by user in settings (not setup yet so we can hardcode for now)
   - Translate non-English input to English using ElevenLabs v3 API
   - Maintain context and nuance during translation
   - Fallback to Flash v2.5 for cost optimization on supported languages

4. **Input Sanitization**
   - Resolve coreference (pronouns, ambiguous references)
   - Disambiguate intent when input is unclear
   - Structure output as clean, formal English prompts
   - Preserve original meaning while improving clarity

5. **Integration & Handoff**
   - Output structured data compatible with existing multi-agent workflow
   - Maintain session context and user preferences
   - Log processing steps for debugging (without storing sensitive data)

### Model Switching Logic
- Use ElevenLabs v3 for complex/uncommon languages
- Use Flash v2.5 for cost optimization on high-volume supported languages
- Implement automatic fallback chains for failed translations

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Latency**: <5 seconds end-to-end processing time
- **Throughput**: Support 10 concurrent users (MVP scale)
- **Response Time**: Audio processing <2s, translation <2s, sanitization <1s

### Reliability
- **Availability**: 99.5% uptime target
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when services fail
- **Error Recovery**: 2 automatic retries with rephrasing before escalation

### Cost Optimization
- Leverage free-tier APIs where possible
- Implement intelligent model routing based on language complexity
- Cache common translations to reduce API calls

### Security & Privacy
- No persistent storage of audio or sensitive content
- Encrypt data in transit to translation services
- Comply with basic data protection practices

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1 - Basic Multilingual Pipeline
- [ ] Voice input successfully captured via CLI microphone interface
- [ ] Text input accepted through command-line prompts
- [ ] ElevenLabs integration translates non-English to English
- [ ] Basic sanitization removes obvious ambiguities and reformats output
- [ ] Processed output successfully handed off to existing workflow

### Phase 2 - Fallback & Error Handling  
- [ ] Fallback routing activates when primary translation fails
- [ ] Error messages provide clear guidance to users
- [ ] System gracefully handles edge cases (mixed languages, garbled input)
- [ ] Performance metrics consistently meet <5s latency target

### Validation Criteria
- Manual testing demonstrates successful round-trips for 5 different languages
- CLI tests show consistent English output structure
- Integration tests confirm compatibility with downstream agents
- Performance tests validate latency requirements under normal load

## Assumptions & Dependencies

### Key Assumptions
1. **ElevenLabs API reliability**: Service provides consistent translation quality and availability
2. **Input quality**: Users provide reasonably clear speech/text (not heavily accented or corrupted)
3. **Language scope**: Focus on 50+ common languages covers 95% of target users
4. **Cost model**: Free-tier usage limits accommodate MVP testing volume
5. **Integration compatibility**: Existing multi-agent workflow can accept structured English prompts

### Validation Approach
- **ElevenLabs reliability**: Monitor API uptime and response quality over 1-week baseline
- **Input quality**: User testing with 10 diverse native speakers across 5 languages  
- **Language coverage**: Analytics review of existing user language preferences
- **Cost sustainability**: Track API usage during testing phase
- **Integration compatibility**: Technical spike to confirm data format alignment

### External Dependencies
- ElevenLabs API access and rate limits
- System microphone access permissions
- Existing multi-agent workflow stability
- CLI testing environment setup

## Edge Cases & Risk Mitigation

### High-Impact Edge Cases
- **Mixed-language utterances**: Implement language segmentation before translation
- **Silent/invalid audio**: Timeout handling with user prompts for retry
- **Translation failures**: Automatic fallback to alternative providers or manual escalation
- **Long-form rambling input**: Chunking strategy for inputs exceeding model limits

### Risk Assessment
- **Service dependency risk**: Medium - Mitigated by fallback provider integration
- **Cost overrun risk**: Low - Free-tier limits and usage monitoring
- **Performance risk**: Medium - Requires optimization testing and potential service scaling

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope
- CLI-based voice and text input processing
- Basic intent sanitization and output structuring
- Integration with existing multi-agent workflow
- Fallback handling for translation failures

### Out of Scope  
- Advanced personalization or user preference learning
- Integrated security/throttling features (handled by future config manager)
- Production-ready web/mobile interface (CLI testing only)
- Comprehensive logging/telemetry/analytics
- Fine-tuning translation models or advanced NLP customization
- Language detection
- Automated grounding with user

## Next Steps

Following successful PRD approval, the next document in sequence will be **RFC001.md** covering:
- Technical architecture design for the input processing pipeline
- API integration specifications for ElevenLabs and fallback services
- Data flow diagrams and component interactions
- Implementation strategy and deployment considerations
- Detailed risk assessment and testing approach

The RFC will reference this PRD's requirements to ensure technical decisions align with product goals and constraints.
