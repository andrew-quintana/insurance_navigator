# PRD001: Output Communication Agent Workflow

## Problem Statement

The Insurance Navigator chat agent pipeline currently produces technical, fragmented outputs from various specialized agent workflows (benefits analysis, eligibility checks, form assistance, etc.). Users receive information that is:
- Disconnected across multiple agent outputs
- Technically accurate but emotionally tone-deaf
- Lacking appropriate sensitivity for healthcare/insurance contexts
- Difficult to understand without insurance expertise
- Missing clear next steps or actionable guidance

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **User Satisfaction**: 90%+ positive feedback on response clarity and tone
- **Comprehension**: 85%+ users report understanding their insurance information
- **Emotional Appropriateness**: 95%+ responses use appropriate tone for content sensitivity
- **Response Time**: <500ms to generate final user-facing response

### Secondary Metrics
- **Consolidation Quality**: 90%+ of responses successfully integrate multiple agent outputs
- **Actionability**: 80%+ of responses include clear next steps when applicable
- **Consistency**: 95%+ tone consistency across similar content types

## User Stories

### Primary Persona: Insurance Navigation User
- **As a user**, I want responses that feel warm and supportive, so I don't feel overwhelmed by insurance complexity
- **As a user**, I want information presented in plain language, so I can understand my benefits without insurance expertise
- **As a user**, I want emotionally appropriate responses, so sensitive topics (like claim denials) are handled with empathy
- **As a user**, I want clear next steps, so I know exactly what to do with the information provided

### Secondary Persona: Customer Support Representative
- **As a support rep**, I want consistent communication tone, so users have a predictable experience across interactions
- **As a support rep**, I want comprehensive responses that address multiple user questions, so I can reduce follow-up inquiries

### Tertiary Persona: Product Manager
- **As a PM**, I want configurable communication styles, so we can adapt to different user preferences and content types
- **As a PM**, I want extensible workflow architecture, so we can easily add new communication features in the future

## Functional Requirements

### Core Communication Capabilities
1. **Information Consolidation**
   - Aggregate structured outputs from multiple upstream agent workflows
   - Resolve conflicts or redundancies between agent outputs
   - Maintain factual accuracy while improving presentation

2. **Tone Adaptation Engine**
   - Apply warm, empathetic communication style as default
   - Adjust emotional sensitivity based on content type indicators
   - Maintain professional yet approachable voice throughout

3. **Content Transformation**
   - Convert technical insurance terminology to plain language
   - Structure information in logical, easy-to-follow formats
   - Add context and examples where helpful for comprehension

4. **Actionability Enhancement**
   - Identify opportunities to provide clear next steps
   - Include relevant contact information or resources
   - Suggest follow-up actions when appropriate

### Integration Requirements
1. **Input Processing**
   - Receive structured data from upstream agent workflows
   - Access user context and interaction history
   - Read content sensitivity indicators and tone preferences

2. **Output Generation**
   - Generate cohesive, user-friendly responses
   - Maintain conversation context and continuity
   - Support multiple output formats (text, structured data, etc.)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Latency**: <500ms response generation time
- **Throughput**: Support 100+ concurrent communication requests
- **Efficiency**: Minimize computational overhead for tone adaptation

### Usability
- **Readability**: 8th grade reading level for insurance explanations
- **Consistency**: Uniform tone and style across all content types
- **Accessibility**: Support for screen readers and assistive technologies

### Reliability
- **Availability**: 99.5% uptime SLA
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fall back to basic formatting if tone adaptation fails
- **Error Handling**: Clear messaging when communication enhancement unavailable

### Maintainability
- **Modularity**: Tone and style rules easily configurable without code changes
- **Extensibility**: Workflow architecture supports adding new communication features
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging of tone adaptation decisions and user feedback

## Assumptions & Dependencies

### Key Assumptions
1. **Structured Input**: Upstream agent workflows provide consistent, structured output formats
2. **Content Sensitivity Indicators**: Upstream workflows include metadata about content sensitivity
3. **User Acceptance**: Users prefer warm, empathetic communication over purely technical responses
4. **Performance Tolerance**: 500ms response generation latency is acceptable for improved communication quality
5. **Reading Level**: Target audience benefits from 8th grade reading level explanations

### Dependencies
- **Upstream**: Multiple specialized agent workflows providing structured data
- **User Context**: Access to user interaction history and preferences
- **Content Guidelines**: Established communication style guides for insurance/healthcare content
- **Monitoring**: Performance and user satisfaction tracking systems

### External Dependencies
- Natural language processing capabilities for tone adaptation
- Content sensitivity classification system (basic metadata only)
- User feedback collection mechanism
- Accessibility compliance validation tools

## Out of Scope (Phase 1)

### Communication Features Deferred to Future Phases
- **Advanced Personalization**: Adaptive communication styles based on user learning patterns
- **Multi-language Support**: Tone adaptation for non-English communications
- **Visual Communication**: Integration with charts, diagrams, or multimedia explanations
- **Real-time Learning**: Dynamic adjustment of communication patterns based on user feedback
- **Custom Style Profiles**: User-configurable communication preferences

### Security & Validation Features (Future Considerations)
- **Content Validation**: Vector similarity checking against user documents
- **Security Enforcement**: Preventing data leakage or unauthorized information disclosure
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating content appropriateness and safety before delivery
- **Compliance Monitoring**: HIPAA and PHI compliance validation and audit trails
