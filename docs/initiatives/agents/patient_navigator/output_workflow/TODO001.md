# TODO001: Output Communication Agent Workflow - MVP Implementation

## Context & Reference Documents

This TODO provides a **simplified implementation plan** for the MVP Output Communication Agent Workflow as defined in:

- **PRD001.md**: `/docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/output_workflow/PRD001.md` - Requirements focusing on communication enhancement
- **RFC001.md**: `/docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/output_workflow/RFC001.md` - Simplified technical approach using LLM-based agent
- **CONTEXT.md**: `/docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/output_workflow/CONTEXT.md` - Core product context

**MVP Deliverable:**
- Single communication agent that takes agent outputs and makes them warm, empathetic, and user-friendly
- Simple workflow wrapper for integration and future extensibility
- Focus on prompt engineering rather than complex architecture

---

## Implementation Overview

### MVP Approach
- **Core**: LLM-based communication agent with specialized prompt
- **Architecture**: Simple workflow wrapper around the agent
- **Integration**: Standard interfaces with existing agent workflows
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks total implementation

### Current Codebase Context
- **Existing patterns**: `agents/patient_navigator/input_processing/` provides workflow structure to follow
- **Integration points**: Existing agent workflows in `agents/patient_navigator/`
- **Testing**: pytest framework already established

---

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Both Phase 1 and Phase 2 have been successfully completed.** The MVP Output Communication Agent is now **production-ready** with comprehensive testing, real Claude Haiku LLM integration, and full documentation.
