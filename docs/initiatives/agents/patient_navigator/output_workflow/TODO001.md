# TODO001: Output Communication Agent Workflow - MVP Implementation

## Context & Reference Documents

This TODO provides a **simplified implementation plan** for the MVP Output Communication Agent Workflow as defined in:

- **PRD001.md**: `/docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/output_workflow/PRD001.md` - Requirements focusing on communication enhancement
- **RFC001.md**: `/docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/output_workflow/RFC001.md` - Simplified technical approach using LLM-based agent
- **CONTEXT.md**: `/docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/output_workflow/CONTEXT.md` - Core product context

**MVP Deliverable:**
- Single communication agent that takes agent outputs and makes them warm, empathetic, and user-friendly
- Simple workflow wrapper for integration and future extensibility
- Focus on prompt engineering rather than complex architecture

---

## Implementation Overview

### MVP Approach
- **Core**: LLM-based communication agent with specialized prompt
- **Architecture**: Simple workflow wrapper around the agent
- **Integration**: Standard interfaces with existing agent workflows
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks total implementation

### Current Codebase Context
- **Existing patterns**: `agents/patient_navigator/input_processing/` provides workflow structure to follow
- **Integration points**: Existing agent workflows in `agents/patient_navigator/`
- **Testing**: pytest framework already established

---

## Single Phase Implementation (1-2 weeks)

### Prerequisites
- Files/documents to read:
  - `/docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/output_workflow/PRD001.md`
  - `/docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/output_workflow/RFC001.md`
  - `/docs/initiatives/agents/patient_navigator/output_workflow/CONTEXT.md`
  - `/agents/patient_navigator/input_processing/` (for existing patterns)
- Session setup: Run `/clear` to start fresh

### Context for Implementation
**IMPORTANT**: This is the MVP implementation focused on a simple, effective communication agent.

The goal is to create a communication agent that transforms technical agent outputs into warm, empathetic, user-friendly responses. This is about prompt engineering and simple integration, not complex architecture.

**Success Criteria:**
- Agent outputs become noticeably warmer and more empathetic
- Insurance terminology is explained in plain language
- Users can easily understand and act on the information
- Integration works with existing agent workflows

- [ ] Include basic logging and monitoring hooks

#### 4. Integration Points
- [ ] Define input interface for receiving agent outputs

- [ ] Add integration with existing agent workflow patterns
- [ ] Create simple consolidation logic for multiple agent outputs (basic text combination)

### Week 2: Testing & Refinement

#### 5. Testing Implementation
- [ ] Create test directory structure: `tests/agents/patient_navigator/output_processing/`
- [ ] Add unit tests for communication agent with sample inputs
- [ ] Create integration tests with mock agent outputs
- [ ] Test various content types: benefits explanations, eligibility results, form assistance, claim guidance

#### 6. Manual Testing & Prompt Refinement
- [ ] Test with real agent outputs from existing workflows
- [ ] Evaluate response quality: warmth, empathy, clarity, actionability
- [ ] Refine communication prompt based on test results
- [ ] Test sensitive vs. routine content handling

#### 7. Integration Testing
- [ ] Test integration with existing agent workflows
- [ ] Verify error handling and fallback behavior
- [ ] Check performance with typical agent output sizes
- [ ] Validate output format meets downstream expectations

#### 8. Documentation & Deployment Prep
- [ ] Add code documentation and usage examples
- [ ] Create simple configuration documentation
- [ ] Add deployment notes for integration
- [ ] Document prompt versioning and refinement process

## Detailed Implementation Guidance

### Communication Agent Prompt Structure

**System Prompt Elements:**
```
Role: You are a warm, empathetic insurance navigator assistant helping users understand their insurance information.

Tone Guidelines:
- Use friendly, supportive language that acknowledges insurance can be stressful
- Show appropriate empathy, especially for sensitive topics like claim denials
- Be encouraging and reassuring while remaining accurate
- Include clear next steps when helpful

Content Rules:
- Convert insurance jargon to plain language with brief explanations
- Structure information clearly with headers or bullet points when helpful
- Always maintain factual accuracy from the original agent outputs
- If multiple agents provided information, integrate it into a cohesive response

Special Handling:
- For claim denials or limitations: Extra empathy, clear explanations, mention alternative options
- For benefits explanations: Focus on clarity and practical examples
- For form assistance: Encouraging tone with step-by-step guidance
- For eligibility results: Clear, supportive messaging about coverage status
```

### Simple Data Models

```python
@dataclass
class AgentOutput:
    agent_id: str
    content: str
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)

@dataclass
class CommunicationRequest:
    agent_outputs: List[AgentOutput]
    user_context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None

@dataclass
class CommunicationResponse:
    enhanced_content: str
    original_sources: List[str]
    processing_time: float
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)
```

### Basic Workflow Structure

```python
class OutputWorkflow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.communication_agent = CommunicationAgent()
    
    async def process_request(self, request: CommunicationRequest) -> CommunicationResponse:
        try:
            # Basic validation
            # Call communication agent
            # Format response
            # Return enhanced content
        except Exception as e:
            # Fallback to original content with error logging
```
