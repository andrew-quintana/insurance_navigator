# Security Investigation Scope and Methodology

**Document**: Investigation Scope  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: September 20, 2025  
**Classification**: CONFIDENTIAL  

## Investigation Scope

### Primary Objectives

1. **Immediate Risk Assessment**: Determine current exposure level and active security threats
2. **Historical Analysis**: Map complete timeline of credential exposure through git history
3. **Infrastructure Audit**: Assess all cloud deployments for security vulnerabilities
4. **Access Control Review**: Evaluate repository and system access patterns
5. **Remediation Strategy**: Develop comprehensive security improvement plan

### Investigation Boundaries

**In Scope**:
- Git repository history analysis (all branches, all commits)
- Render.com deployment configurations
- Vercel deployment configurations
- CI/CD pipeline security assessment
- Repository access logs and permissions
- Third-party service integrations

**Out of Scope**:
- Internal network security assessment
- Physical security review
- Social engineering assessment
- Penetration testing of live systems

### Key Investigation Questions

1. **Exposure Timeline**: When were credentials first committed to the repository?
2. **Access Patterns**: Who has accessed the repository during exposure period?
3. **Distribution**: Where else might these credentials have been shared or stored?
4. **Active Usage**: Are these credentials currently active in production systems?
5. **Potential Compromise**: Evidence of unauthorized access or usage?

## Methodology

### Phase-Based Approach

Each investigation phase follows a structured methodology:

1. **Information Gathering**: Collect relevant data and evidence
2. **Analysis**: Examine findings for security implications
3. **Documentation**: Record findings in standardized format
4. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate impact and likelihood
5. **Recommendations**: Propose specific remediation actions

### Evidence Standards

- All findings must be reproducible with documented commands
- Screenshots and logs must include timestamps
- File paths must be absolute for verification
- Git commit hashes must be full SHA values
- Access logs must include user identification

### Risk Classification

**Critical**: Immediate threat to system security or data integrity  
**High**: Significant security vulnerability requiring urgent attention  
**Medium**: Security weakness that should be addressed in planned timeframe  
**Low**: Security improvement opportunity with minimal immediate risk  

## Investigation Tools and Resources

### Required Tools

- Git command line tools
- GitHub/GitLab API access
- Cloud platform CLI tools (Render, Vercel)
- Text search tools (grep, ripgrep, ack)
- Log analysis tools
- Security scanning tools

### Data Sources

- Git repository (all branches and history)
- Cloud deployment configurations
- CI/CD pipeline logs
- Repository access logs
- Third-party service audit logs
- Team communication records

### Reference Materials

- Company security policies
- Industry security standards
- Compliance requirements
- Previous security assessments

## Reporting Structure

### Interim Reports

Each phase produces an interim report containing:
- Executive summary of findings
- Detailed analysis results
- Risk assessment matrix
- Immediate recommendations
- Next phase preparation

### Final Report

Comprehensive security assessment including:
- Complete findings summary
- Risk impact analysis
- Remediation roadmap
- Prevention recommendations
- Compliance assessment

## Confidentiality and Access Control

**Document Classification**: CONFIDENTIAL  
**Access Level**: Security Personnel Only  
**Distribution**: Restricted to investigation team and designated stakeholders  

**Handling Requirements**:
- No credential information in plain text in reports
- Use redacted examples where necessary
- Secure storage of all investigation materials
- Controlled access to investigation workspace
