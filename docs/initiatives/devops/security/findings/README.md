## Findings Categories

### Critical Findings
**Definition**: Findings that require immediate action or indicate active security threats  
**Response Time**: 0-24 hours  
**Examples**: Active credential exposure, ongoing unauthorized access, critical system vulnerabilities  

### High Priority Findings
**Definition**: Findings that indicate significant security risks requiring urgent attention  
**Response Time**: 24-72 hours  
**Examples**: Historical credential exposure, access control gaps, policy violations  

### Medium Priority Findings  
**Definition**: Findings that indicate security improvements needed but no immediate threat  
**Response Time**: 1-2 weeks  
**Examples**: Security policy gaps, training needs, process improvements  

### Low Priority Findings
**Definition**: Findings that represent best practice improvements or minor security enhancements  
**Response Time**: 2-4 weeks  
**Examples**: Documentation improvements, monitoring enhancements, compliance updates
