## Phase 6: Investigation Cleanup (CRITICAL)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY CLEANUP PHASE**: After completing the investigation and remediation, ALL files containing sensitive information must be removed or sanitized.

### 6.1 Documentation Cleanup Tasks
- [ ] Remove all investigation files containing actual credentials
- [ ] Delete the original RENDER_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md file
- [ ] Sanitize any remaining documentation to remove credential references
- [ ] Remove exposed_credentials_catalog.md and similar files
- [ ] Clean up any investigation prompts containing actual credential values
- [ ] Verify no sensitive information remains in the security initiative directory

### 6.2 Repository History Cleanup
- [ ] Use git filter-branch or BFG to remove credential history
- [ ] Verify git history is clean of all exposed credentials
- [ ] Force push cleaned history (if safe to do so)
- [ ] Document the cleanup process for audit purposes

### 6.3 Final Security Verification
- [ ] Run comprehensive credential scan on entire repository
- [ ] Verify no sensitive information exists in any branch
- [ ] Confirm all team members understand new security procedures
- [ ] Archive investigation summary without sensitive details

**CLEANUP DEADLINE**: Phase 6 must be completed within 48 hours of Phase 5 completion to ensure no sensitive information remains in the repository.

---

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTICE**: Phase 5 remediation must be executed with extreme care to avoid service disruptions while ensuring complete security. All actions should be tested in staging environments before production implementation.

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY CLEANUP NOTICE**: Phase 6 cleanup is REQUIRED and must not be skipped. Leaving credential information in investigation files defeats the purpose of the security remediation.
