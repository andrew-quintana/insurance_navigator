# Phase 2: Historical Analysis

**Phase**: 2 - Historical Analysis  
**Priority**: ðŸ“š HIGH  
**Timeline**: 48 hours  
**Status**: Pending Phase 1 Completion  

## Phase Objectives

1. **Complete Repository Credential Archaeology**: Comprehensive analysis of entire git history for any credential exposure
2. **Past Commit Analysis for Leaked Secrets**: Deep dive into commit history to find removed or rotated credentials
3. **Timeline of Exposure Events**: Create complete chronological record of all security-relevant events

## Investigation Areas

### Area 1: Deep Git History Analysis
**Objective**: Analyze complete repository history across all branches for credential patterns  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Timeline**: 16 hours  

### Area 2: Credential Evolution Tracking
**Objective**: Track how credentials have changed, been rotated, or removed over time  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Timeline**: 12 hours  

### Area 3: Branch and Fork Analysis
**Objective**: Analyze all branches, tags, and potential forks for credential exposure  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Timeline**: 8 hours  

### Area 4: External Repository Risk Assessment
**Objective**: Assess if credentials may have been pushed to external repositories or services  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Timeline**: 8 hours  

### Area 5: Historical Access Pattern Analysis
**Objective**: Analyze historical access patterns and potential compromise indicators  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Timeline**: 4 hours  

## Prerequisites

**Phase 1 Completion Required**:
- [ ] Phase 1 immediate assessment completed
- [ ] Current credential exposure documented
- [ ] Immediate risks mitigated
- [ ] Active service impact understood

## Phase 2 Deliverables

- [ ] Complete git history credential analysis report
- [ ] Credential evolution timeline with all changes
- [ ] Branch and tag analysis for credential distribution
- [ ] External repository risk assessment
- [ ] Historical security incident timeline
- [ ] Comprehensive exposure archaeology report

[See: `investigation_prompt_2_1_complete_history.md`]

### Prompt 2.2: Credential Evolution and Rotation Tracking
[See: `investigation_prompt_2_2_credential_evolution.md`]

### Prompt 2.3: Branch and Fork Security Analysis
[See: `investigation_prompt_2_3_branch_analysis.md`]

### Prompt 2.5: Historical Access Pattern Analysis
[See: `investigation_prompt_2_5_access_patterns.md`]

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 2, we should have:

1. **Complete Credential Timeline**: Every instance of credential exposure in repository history
2. **Rotation History**: Understanding of any credential rotation attempts or changes
3. **Exposure Scope**: Complete picture of where credentials may have been distributed
4. **Risk Assessment**: Understanding of historical exposure risks and potential compromise
5. **Forensic Evidence**: Complete audit trail for compliance and incident response

## Success Criteria

- âœ… Complete git history analyzed (all commits, all branches)
- âœ… All credential instances documented with timelines
- âœ… Credential rotation history mapped
- âœ… External exposure risk assessed
- âœ… Historical access patterns analyzed
- âœ… Forensic timeline established for compliance

## Phase 2 Team Assignments

**Lead Investigator**: Senior DevOps Engineer  
**Git History Analysis**: Git/VCS Specialist  
**Branch Analysis**: Repository Administrator  
**External Risk Assessment**: Security Analyst  
**Access Pattern Analysis**: Infrastructure Security Engineer  

## Tools and Resources Required

### Technical Tools
- Advanced git commands and scripting
- Repository analysis tools (git-secrets, truffleHog, etc.)
- Log analysis tools
- External service APIs (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)

### Access Requirements
- Full repository administrator access
- Historical access logs (if available)
- External service account access
- Version control system audit logs

## Risk Considerations

**Investigation Risks**:
- Large repository history may require significant processing time
- External services may have API rate limits
- Historical logs may be incomplete or archived
- Analysis may discover additional critical exposures

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Parallel processing where possible
- Staged analysis approach for large repositories
- Multiple analysis tools for comprehensive coverage
- Regular checkpoint reporting to stakeholders

## Integration with Other Phases

**Feeds Into Phase 3**:
- Historical findings inform cloud deployment analysis
- Timeline data supports infrastructure audit
- External exposure data guides cloud security review

**Dependencies from Phase 1**:
- Current exposure baseline for comparison
- Active service impact for prioritization
- Immediate risk assessment for scope

## Communication Plan

**Daily Standup**: Progress updates and blocking issues  
**Milestone Reports**: Completion of each investigation area  
**Escalation Protocol**: Immediate notification for critical discoveries  
**Final Report**: Comprehensive historical analysis summary
