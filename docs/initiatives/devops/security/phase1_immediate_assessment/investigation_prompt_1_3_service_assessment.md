# Investigation Prompt 1.3: Active Service Assessment

**Prompt ID**: SECURITY-P1.3  
**Area**: Active Service Impact Evaluation  
**Priority**: ðŸš¨ CRITICAL  
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours  

## Investigation Objective

Determine which of the exposed credentials are actively being used by deployed services, assess the immediate impact of credential exposure, and identify which services need urgent credential rotation.

## Context and Background

**Known Exposed Credentials**:
- OpenAI API Key: `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`

```

### Task 1.3.4: Service Configuration Analysis

Check for service-specific configuration and startup files:

```bash
# Check for Docker configuration
find /Users/aq_home/1Projects/accessa/insurance_navigator -name "Dockerfile*" -o -name "docker-compose*"

# Check for application startup files
find /Users/aq_home/1Projects/accessa/insurance_navigator -name "server.*" -o -name "app.*" -o -name "main.*" | grep -v node_modules

# Look for environment loading in application
grep -r -E "(dotenv|loadenv|env)" /Users/aq_home/1Projects/accessa/insurance_navigator --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git | head -20
```

### Task 1.3.5: Database Connection Assessment

Analyze database connection usage:

```bash
# Look for database connection code
grep -r -E "(createClient|postgres|pool|connection)" /Users/aq_home/1Projects/accessa/insurance_navigator --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git

# Look for LangChain usage
grep -r -i "langchain" /Users/aq_home/1Projects/accessa/insurance_navigator --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git
```

## Investigation Questions

1. **Active Usage**: Which exposed credentials are currently active in deployed services?
2. **Service Dependencies**: Which services would break if credentials were rotated immediately?
3. **Environment Segregation**: Are different credentials used for staging vs production?
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Do services have fallback authentication or graceful degradation?
5. **Impact Assessment**: What is the immediate impact of rotating each credential?

## Expected Findings Format

## Risk Assessment Criteria

**Critical Risk Indicators**:
- Credential is required for core service functionality
- Service is currently active and receiving traffic
- No immediate fallback or redundancy available
- Credential rotation would cause service outage

**High Risk Indicators**:
- Credential is used but service has graceful degradation
- Alternative authentication methods available
- Service can operate with reduced functionality

**Medium Risk Indicators**:
- Credential is configured but not actively used
- Service has multiple authentication options
- Non-critical service functionality

## Deliverables

1. **Service Status Report**: Current status of all deployed services
2. **Credential Usage Matrix**: Which credentials are used by which services
3. **Impact Assessment**: Estimated downtime and service disruption for credential rotation
4. **Rotation Priority List**: Ordered list of credentials to rotate based on risk
5. **Service Health Baseline**: Current service performance metrics before rotation

## Success Criteria

- âœ… All deployed services identified and analyzed
- âœ… Credential usage confirmed for each exposed credential  
- âœ… Impact assessment completed for credential rotation
- âœ… Service health baseline established
- âœ… Rotation priority list created with timeline estimates

## Next Steps

Upon completion:
1. Create credential rotation plan with prioritized timeline
2. Notify service owners of required maintenance windows
3. Proceed to Investigation Prompt 1.4 (Risk Assessment)
4. Prepare for emergency credential rotation if critical services are affected
