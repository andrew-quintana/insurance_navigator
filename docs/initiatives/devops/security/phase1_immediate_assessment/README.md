# Phase 1: Immediate Assessment

**Phase**: 1 - Immediate Assessment  
**Priority**: ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL SECURITY INCIDENT**  
**Timeline**: 24 hours  
**Status**: Ready to Execute  

## Phase Objectives

1. **Current Credential Exposure Analysis**: Identify all exposed credentials and assess their current active status
2. **Git History Credential Scan**: Perform immediate scan of recent git history for credential patterns
3. **Active Service Impact Evaluation**: Determine which services are currently using exposed credentials

## Investigation Areas

### Area 1: Current Repository Credential Scan
**Objective**: Find all currently exposed credentials in the repository  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Timeline**: 2 hours  
**Lead**: Infrastructure Engineer  

**Specific Tasks:**
- [ ] Install and configure credential scanning tools (gitleaks, trufflehog)
- [ ] Perform comprehensive repository scan for exposed credentials
- [ ] Validate discovered credentials against known patterns
- [ ] Cross-reference findings with RENDER_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md
- [ ] Document all discovered credentials with exposure context
- [ ] Generate prioritized credential inventory

**Expected Outputs:**
- Complete credential inventory with exposure details
- Raw scan outputs for evidence preservation
- Credential validation results and active status

### Area 2: Recent Git History Analysis  
**Objective**: Scan recent commits for additional credential exposure  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Timeline**: 4 hours  
**Lead**: Security Analyst  

**Specific Tasks:**
- [ ] Configure git history scanning tools and parameters
- [ ] Scan commits from last 30 days for credential patterns
- [ ] Analyze commit messages for security-related changes
- [ ] Review file modification history for sensitive files
- [ ] Identify potential credential additions/removals timeline
- [ ] Cross-correlate history findings with current exposure

**Expected Outputs:**
- Git history credential exposure timeline
- Commit-level analysis of credential changes
- Historical context for current credential exposure

### Area 3: Active Service Assessment
**Objective**: Determine which credentials are actively used in deployments  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Timeline**: 2 hours  
**Lead**: Platform Engineer  

**Specific Tasks:**
- [ ] Test API key validity and current access levels
- [ ] Verify database connection credentials and permissions
- [ ] Check service deployment configurations on Render/Vercel
- [ ] Assess current service functionality and dependencies
- [ ] Map credential usage to specific service functions
- [ ] Document service impact of potential credential rotation

**Expected Outputs:**
- Active service credential mapping
- API key validation and usage assessment
- Service impact analysis for remediation planning

### Area 4: Immediate Risk Evaluation
**Objective**: Assess immediate security risks and prioritize response  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Timeline**: 1 hour  
**Lead**: DevOps Security Lead  

**Specific Tasks:**
- [ ] Analyze exposure scope and potential impact
- [ ] Assess likelihood and methods of unauthorized access
- [ ] Evaluate current monitoring and detection capabilities
- [ ] Prioritize credentials by risk level and business impact
- [ ] Develop immediate response action recommendations
- [ ] Prepare stakeholder communication requirements

**Expected Outputs:**
- Risk assessment matrix with prioritized threats
- Immediate action recommendations
- Stakeholder notification requirements  

## Phase 1 Deliverables

### Core Investigation Reports
- [ ] Complete repository credential scan results (investigation_prompt_1_1_repository_scan.md)
- [ ] Recent git history analysis report (investigation_prompt_1_2_git_history.md)  
- [ ] Active service credential mapping (investigation_prompt_1_3_service_assessment.md)
- [ ] Immediate risk assessment matrix (investigation_prompt_1_4_risk_assessment.md)
- [ ] Phase 1 comprehensive summary report

### Evidence Collection
- [ ] Raw scan outputs (gitleaks, trufflehog, grep results)
- [ ] Screenshot documentation of critical findings
- [ ] API key validation test results
- [ ] Service connection verification logs
- [ ] Credential exposure timeline documentation

### Action Items and Notifications
- [ ] Critical credential rotation priority list
- [ ] Immediate service security hardening recommendations
- [ ] Stakeholder notification requirements
- [ ] Emergency response action checklist
- [ ] Phase 2 investigation scope refinement

## Investigation Prompts

### Prompt 1.1: Repository-Wide Credential Scan
[See: `investigation_prompt_1_1_repository_scan.md`]

### Prompt 1.2: Git History Credential Analysis
[See: `investigation_prompt_1_2_git_history.md`]

### Prompt 1.3: Active Service Assessment
[See: `investigation_prompt_1_3_service_assessment.md`]

### Prompt 1.4: Risk Assessment and Prioritization
[See: `investigation_prompt_1_4_risk_assessment.md`]

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 1, we should have:

1. **Complete Inventory**: All exposed credentials identified and cataloged
2. **Exposure Timeline**: Understanding of when credentials were first exposed
3. **Active Usage Map**: Which credentials are currently active in services
4. **Risk Matrix**: Prioritized list of security risks and required actions
5. **Immediate Actions**: Specific steps to mitigate immediate threats

## Success Criteria

- âœ… All exposed credentials identified and documented
- âœ… Git history scanned for credential patterns (last 30 days minimum)
- âœ… Active service usage confirmed for each credential
- âœ… Risk assessment completed with priority rankings
- âœ… Immediate action items identified and assigned

## Phase 1 Team Assignments

**Primary Investigator**: DevOps Security Lead  
**Repository Analysis**: Infrastructure Engineer  
**Service Assessment**: Platform Engineer  
**Risk Assessment**: Security Analyst  

## Escalation Criteria

Immediate escalation required if:
- Evidence of unauthorized access or usage
- Additional critical credentials discovered
- Active security breaches detected
- Compliance implications identified
