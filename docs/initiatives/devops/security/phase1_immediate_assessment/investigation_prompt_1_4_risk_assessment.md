# Investigation Prompt 1.4: Risk Assessment and Prioritization

**Prompt ID**: SECURITY-P1.4  
**Area**: Immediate Risk Evaluation  
**Priority**: ðŸš¨ CRITICAL  
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour  

## Investigation Objective

Synthesize findings from Phase 1 investigations to create a comprehensive risk assessment, prioritize remediation actions, and establish immediate response protocols for the credential exposure incident.

## Context and Background

This prompt assumes completion of:
- **Prompt 1.1**: Repository-wide credential scan results
- **Prompt 1.2**: Git history credential analysis
- **Prompt 1.3**: Active service assessment

**Integration Point**: This assessment will combine all Phase 1 findings to create actionable priorities for immediate response.

## Investigation Tasks

### Task 1.4.1: Credential Risk Classification

Based on previous investigation findings, classify each exposed credential:

**Classification Framework**:
```markdown
CRITICAL (P0 - Immediate Action Required):
- Credentials with full database access
- Production API keys with billing implications
- Encryption keys protecting sensitive data
- Credentials in active use by production services

HIGH (P1 - Action Required within 4 hours):
- Development/staging API keys with service access
- Credentials with limited scope but active usage
- Authentication tokens with extended validity

MEDIUM (P2 - Action Required within 24 hours):
- Inactive or development-only credentials
- Credentials with limited access scope
- Non-production environment credentials

LOW (P3 - Action Required within 72 hours):
- Demo or test credentials
- Expired or inactive credentials
- Public/anonymous access tokens
```

### Task 1.4.2: Exposure Impact Analysis

For each credential, assess the potential impact of unauthorized access:

**Impact Assessment Matrix**:
```markdown
## Data Access Impact
- **Database Credentials**: Full read/write access to user data
- **API Keys**: Service access, potential billing abuse
- **Encryption Keys**: Ability to decrypt sensitive documents

## Financial Impact  
- **OpenAI API**: Potential for high-volume API abuse, billing impact
- **Anthropic API**: Potential for API abuse, service limits
- **Cloud Services**: Resource provisioning, infrastructure costs

## Service Disruption Impact
- **Critical Path Dependencies**: Services that would fail without credentials
- **User Experience**: Features that would break with credential rotation
- **Business Operations**: Impact on core business functions
```

### Task 1.4.3: Timeline Risk Assessment

Evaluate the urgency based on exposure timeline from git history analysis:

**Timeline Risk Factors**:
```markdown
## Exposure Duration Risk
- **Recent Exposure (< 7 days)**: Lower risk of discovery/abuse
- **Medium Exposure (7-30 days)**: Moderate risk of unauthorized access  
- **Extended Exposure (> 30 days)**: High risk of compromise
- **Long-term Exposure (> 90 days)**: Critical risk assessment

## Repository Access Risk
- **Private Repository**: Lower risk of external access
- **Public Repository**: Critical risk of widespread exposure
- **Forked Repositories**: Risk of exposure in derivative projects
- **Archive/Backup Risk**: Risk in backup systems or mirrors
```

### Task 1.4.4: Active Threat Assessment

Assess evidence of potential unauthorized access:

**Threat Indicators to Evaluate**:
```markdown
## Usage Pattern Analysis
- **Unexpected API Usage**: Unusual patterns in API logs
- **Database Access Anomalies**: Unexpected query patterns
- **Service Errors**: Authentication failures or unusual errors
- **Billing Anomalies**: Unexpected charges or usage spikes

## External Intelligence
- **Security Monitoring**: Alerts from security systems
- **Third-party Reports**: Notifications from service providers
- **Community Reports**: Public security reports or discussions
```

### Task 1.4.5: Business Impact Assessment

Evaluate the business risk and compliance implications:

**Business Risk Categories**:
```markdown
## Regulatory Compliance
- **Data Protection**: GDPR, CCPA compliance implications
- **Healthcare**: HIPAA compliance if health data is involved
- **Financial**: PCI compliance if payment data is accessed
- **Industry**: Sector-specific compliance requirements

## Reputation Risk
- **Customer Trust**: Impact on customer confidence
- **Partner Relations**: Impact on business partnerships
- **Public Disclosure**: Requirements for public notification
- **Media Coverage**: Potential for negative publicity

## Operational Risk
- **Service Availability**: Risk of service disruption
- **Data Integrity**: Risk of data modification or loss
- **Recovery Time**: Time to restore normal operations
- **Resource Requirements**: Staff and resources needed for response
```

### Task 1.4.6: Immediate Action Prioritization

Create prioritized action plan based on risk assessment:

**Priority Matrix**:
```markdown
## P0 - IMMEDIATE (Next 1 Hour)
1. [Action item with specific credential/service]
2. [Action item with specific credential/service]

## P1 - URGENT (Next 4 Hours)  
1. [Action item with specific credential/service]
2. [Action item with specific credential/service]

## P2 - HIGH (Next 24 Hours)
1. [Action item with specific credential/service]
2. [Action item with specific credential/service]

## P3 - MEDIUM (Next 72 Hours)
1. [Action item with specific credential/service]
2. [Action item with specific credential/service]
```

## Investigation Questions

1. **Risk Severity**: What is the overall severity of this security incident?
2. **Immediate Threats**: Is there evidence of active unauthorized access?
3. **Business Impact**: What are the potential financial and operational consequences?
4. **Recovery Time**: How long will it take to fully remediate the exposure?
5. **Prevention**: What immediate steps can prevent similar incidents?

## Expected Findings Format

```markdown
## Phase 1 Risk Assessment Summary

### Overall Incident Classification
- **Severity Level**: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
- **Incident Type**: Credential Exposure via Repository
- **Discovery Date**: September 20, 2025
- **Estimated Exposure Duration**: [timeframe]
- **Affected Systems**: [list of systems/services]

### Risk Matrix
| Credential | Risk Level | Business Impact | Technical Impact | Timeline |
