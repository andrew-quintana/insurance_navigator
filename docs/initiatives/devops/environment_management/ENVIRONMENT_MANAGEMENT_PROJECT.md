# Environment Management Project - Comprehensive Plan

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive environment management implementation project for the insurance_navigator application. The staging infrastructure has been established (Phases 1-4 completed), and this document outlines the remaining phases for complete environment-agnostic implementation.

## Completed Infrastructure Setup (Phases 1-4)
✅ **Phase 1**: Production Service Discovery and Documentation - COMPLETED  
✅ **Phase 2**: Staging Environment Planning - COMPLETED  
✅ **Phase 3**: Staging API Service Creation - COMPLETED  
✅ **Phase 4**: Staging Worker Service Creation - COMPLETED  

**Current Status**: 
- insurance-navigator-staging-api service created and configured
- insurance-navigator-staging-worker service created and configured
- Both services connected to existing staging database from .env.staging
- Ready to proceed with validation, research, and implementation phases

## Remaining Project Phases

- [ ] Update frontend error handling for configuration issues

### Phase 12: Backend Service Environment Integration
**Objective**: Refactor backend services for environment-agnostic operation

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Update API endpoint configurations to use environment variables
- [ ] Refactor authentication services for environment-specific settings

- [ ] Implement environment-aware service discovery
- [ ] Update middleware for environment-specific behavior

### Phase 13: Build System and CI/CD Integration
**Objective**: Update build system for environment-aware builds

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Update package.json scripts for environment-specific builds
