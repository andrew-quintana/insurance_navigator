# Environment Management Initiative - Comprehensive Project

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive environment management implementation project for the insurance_navigator application. The project establishes complete environment-agnostic operations with seamless transitions between development, staging, and production environments.

## Project Status
✅ **Phases 1-4 COMPLETED**: Staging infrastructure successfully established
- insurance-navigator-staging-api service created and configured
- insurance-navigator-staging-worker service created and configured  
- Both services connected to existing staging database from .env.staging
- Ready for validation, research, and implementation phases (Phases 5-17)

## Project Structure
All project documentation and specifications are organized under the existing directory structure:

### Infrastructure Setup Documentation (`./infrastructure_setup/`)
**Status**: Phases 1-4 completed, contains staging infrastructure specifications and configurations

**Sub-directories**:
- `refactor_specification/` - Technical specifications for staging service replication
- `phased_planning/` - All 17 project phases with comprehensive todos and prompts
- `service_replication/` - Documentation and procedures for service replication
- `configuration_management/` - Staging service configuration management
- `validation_procedures/` - Infrastructure testing and validation procedures

### Project Documentation
All project phases and documentation are centralized in the infrastructure_setup directory for streamlined management.

## Key Principles

### Environment Workflow
1. **Infrastructure First**: Staging infrastructure established before code changes
2. **Development First**: All changes begin in development environment
3. **Staging Validation**: Mandatory staging environment testing and approval using replicated infrastructure
4. **Production Promotion**: Only staging-validated changes deploy to production
5. **No Direct Production**: Strict prohibition of development-to-production deployments

### Configuration Management
1. **Environment Agnosticism**: Code works consistently across all environments
2. **Configuration Isolation**: Environment-specific values only in .env files
3. **Centralized Loading**: Single configuration system for all modules
4. **Validation Required**: Automated validation of all environment configurations

### Agent Guidelines
1. **Infrastructure Setup Prompts**: Focus on Render service replication and staging infrastructure creation
2. **Research Prompts**: Focus on discovery and documentation, no implementation
3. **Execution Prompts**: Focus on implementation based on research findings and staging infrastructure
4. **Phased Approach**: Each stage has clear phases with specific deliverables
5. **Documentation Reference**: All prompts reference specific documentation locations
6. **Render MCP Integration**: Use Render MCP for infrastructure setup and maintenance tasks

## Usage Instructions

### Current Status - Ready for Phase 5
**Infrastructure Setup (Phases 1-4) ✅ COMPLETED**
- Staging services created and configured
- Ready to proceed with remaining phases

### Continue from Phase 5
1. **Primary Documentation**: Use `COMPREHENSIVE_PHASE_PROMPTS.md` for all remaining phases (5-17)
2. **Todo Tracking**: Update todos in `infrastructure_setup/phased_planning/INFRASTRUCTURE_PHASE_TODOS.md`
3. **Phase-by-Phase Execution**: Complete phases sequentially from 5-17
4. **Documentation**: Document findings in appropriate subdirectories based on phase type:
   - Phases 5-7: Research and validation - use `research_stage/` subdirectories
   - Phases 8-17: Implementation - use `execution_stage/` subdirectories

### Key Reference Documents
- **Complete Project Plan**: `ENVIRONMENT_MANAGEMENT_PROJECT.md`
- **All Phase Prompts**: `COMPREHENSIVE_PHASE_PROMPTS.md`
- **Detailed Todos**: `infrastructure_setup/phased_planning/INFRASTRUCTURE_PHASE_TODOS.md`
- **Staging Infrastructure Specs**: `infrastructure_setup/refactor_specification/STAGING_INFRASTRUCTURE_SPEC.md`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Staging infrastructure successfully replicated and operational
- [ ] insurance-navigator-staging-api service functional and accessible
- [ ] insurance-navigator-staging-worker service processing jobs correctly
- [ ] Complete codebase environment dependency audit
- [ ] Zero hardcoded environment values in codebase
- [ ] Consistent environment variable patterns across all modules
- [ ] Automated testing validates environment configurations
- [ ] Seamless development → staging → production workflow using staging infrastructure
- [ ] Comprehensive deployment procedures with safety checks
- [ ] 100% configuration test coverage
- [ ] Successful automated environment promotions
- [ ] Staging infrastructure properly maintained via Render MCP

## Project Timeline
**Completed**: Phases 1-4 (Infrastructure Setup) ✅  
**Remaining**: Phases 5-17 (4-6 weeks estimated)

**Remaining Phase Timeline**:
- Phases 5-7 (Validation & Research): 1-2 weeks
- Phases 8-13 (Core Implementation): 2-3 weeks  
- Phases 14-17 (Testing & Documentation): 1 week

## Documentation Standards
All documentation follows a consistent structure with clear separation between research findings and implementation specifications. Prompts are designed to be execution-detail-free, focusing agents on the appropriate phase objectives and referencing relevant documentation for context.
