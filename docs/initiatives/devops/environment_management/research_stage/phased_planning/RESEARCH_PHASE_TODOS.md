# Research Stage - Phased Todo List

## Phase 1: Environment Variable Discovery
- [ ] Scan all `.env*` files in the project
- [ ] Search for `process.env` usage across all TypeScript/JavaScript files
- [ ] Identify hardcoded environment-specific values
- [ ] Document current environment variable patterns

## Phase 2: Configuration File Analysis
- [ ] Analyze all configuration files (config/, shared/, etc.)
- [ ] Identify environment-specific configuration patterns
- [ ] Document configuration loading mechanisms
- [ ] Map configuration dependencies

## Phase 3: Module-Level Environment Dependencies
- [ ] Audit frontend components for environment-specific behavior
- [ ] Analyze backend services for environment switches
- [ ] Review database connection configurations
- [ ] Examine API endpoint configurations
- [ ] Check authentication/authorization environment dependencies

## Phase 4: Build and Deployment Analysis
- [ ] Review build scripts and configurations
- [ ] Analyze deployment-related files
- [ ] Identify CI/CD environment dependencies
- [ ] Document testing environment requirements

## Phase 5: Third-Party Service Integration
- [ ] Audit external API configurations
- [ ] Review cloud service environment settings
- [ ] Check logging and monitoring service configurations
- [ ] Analyze payment and integration service settings

## Phase 6: Documentation and Validation
- [ ] Create comprehensive environment dependency map
- [ ] Validate findings with code testing
- [ ] Document transition requirements for each identified dependency
- [ ] Prepare recommendations for execution stage
