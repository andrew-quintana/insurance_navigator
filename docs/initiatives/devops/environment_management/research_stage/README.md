# Environment Management Research Stage

## Overview
This stage focuses on investigating the codebase to identify all locations where environment-specific configurations, variables, and logic need to be modified to support seamless transitions between development, staging, and production environments.

## Objectives
- Identify all environment-dependent code locations
- Map existing environment variable usage patterns
- Document current configuration approaches
- Create transition requirements for each module/workflow

## Directory Structure

### `/codebase_analysis/`
Contains systematic analysis of the entire codebase to identify environment dependencies.

### `/module_identification/`
Organized breakdown of modules that require environment-specific handling.

### `/workflow_mapping/`
Documentation of workflows and their environment transition requirements.

### `/phased_planning/`
Structured todo lists and planning documents for systematic research execution.

## Key Deliverables
1. Comprehensive environment dependency audit
2. Module-specific transition requirements
3. Workflow environment mapping
4. Phased research execution plan

## Research Methodology
1. **Systematic Code Scanning**: Search for environment variables, configuration files, and conditional logic
2. **Module Analysis**: Examine each major system component for environment dependencies
3. **Workflow Tracing**: Map user and system workflows that span environments
4. **Documentation**: Create detailed findings that inform execution stage planning
