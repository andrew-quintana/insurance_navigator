4. **AUDIT_SUMMARY.md** - This summary document

## Key Findings

### Service Architecture
- **Runtime**: Docker-based services with Python 3.11
- **Region**: Oregon (us-west-2)
- **Plan**: Starter plan for both services
- **Auto Deploy**: Enabled for both services on `deployment/cloud-infrastructure` branch

### Configuration Highlights
- **Multi-stage Docker builds** for optimized deployment
- **Comprehensive health checks** with proper endpoints
- **Environment-aware configuration** management
- **Resilience systems** with circuit breakers and degradation managers
- **Structured logging** with appropriate log levels

### Dependencies Identified
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with asyncpg connection pooling
- **External APIs**: OpenAI, LlamaParse, Anthropic (optional)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage with direct HTTP access
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime for status updates

### Environment Variables
- **Total Variables**: 25+ environment variables identified
- **Categories**: Core, Database, API, Service, RAG, Worker-specific
- **Security**: Sensitive variables properly identified
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation logic in place

## Service Configurations

### API Service
- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build with Python 3.11-slim
- **Port**: 8000 with health check endpoint
- **Start Command**: uvicorn with optimized settings
- **Health Check**: `/health` endpoint with service manager integration
- **Middleware**: CORS, error handling, request logging

### Worker Service
- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build with Python 3.11-slim
- **Start Command**: Enhanced worker runner
- **Health Check**: Import validation for enhanced base worker
- **Processing**: Background job processing with retry logic

## Recent Activity

### Deployment History
Both services show recent active development with multiple deployments in September 2025:
- **FM-018**: Resolve generic response generation issue
- **FM-017**: Worker storage access issue
- **FM-016**: Parsed content empty error
- **FM-015**: Database system configuration
- **FM-014**: Mock service fallback issues

### Performance Status
- **Metrics**: No recent performance data available (services may be in idle state)
- **Health**: Services are operational and responding to health checks
- **Deployments**: Recent successful deployments indicate active development

## Staging Replication Requirements

### Configuration Preservation
- **Runtime**: Docker (both services)
- **Build Process**: Identical multi-stage builds
- **Health Checks**: Same health check endpoints
- **Ports**: Same port configurations
- **Resource Allocation**: Starter plan (or staging-appropriate)

### Environment Adaptations
- **Database**: Staging database instances
- **API Keys**: Staging/test API keys
- **Service URLs**: Staging-specific endpoints
- **CORS Origins**: Staging domain configurations
- **Logging**: Staging-appropriate log levels

### Dependencies Setup
- **Staging Database**: Separate Supabase project or staging schema
- **External APIs**: Staging/test API endpoints
- **Storage**: Staging storage buckets
- **Monitoring**: Staging-specific logging and alerting

## Security Considerations

### Current Security
- **No hardcoded secrets** (recently fixed)
- **Environment-based configuration** management
- **Service role keys** for Supabase access
- **JWT-based authentication**
- **CORS configuration** for cross-origin requests

### Staging Security
- **Staging-specific API keys** with limited scope
- **Staging database isolation** from production
- **Staging-specific CORS origins**
- **Staging monitoring** and alerting

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Create staging services** using Render MCP with identical base configurations
2. **Configure staging environment variables** with staging-specific values
3. **Set up staging database** and external service connections
4. **Validate staging service functionality** and health checks
5. **Implement staging monitoring** and alerting

### Long-term Considerations
1. **Configuration drift prevention** with automated comparison
2. **Regular audits** of service configuration consistency
3. **Version control** for service configuration templates
4. **Emergency procedures** for infrastructure issues
