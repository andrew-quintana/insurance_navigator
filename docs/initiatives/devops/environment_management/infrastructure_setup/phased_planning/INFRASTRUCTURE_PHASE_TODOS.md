# Infrastructure Setup Stage - Phased Todo List

## Phase 1: Production Service Discovery and Documentation
- [x] Audit current insurance-navigator-api Render service configuration
- [x] Document all production API service settings and specifications
- [x] Inventory all environment variables used by production API service
- [x] Audit current insurance-navigator-worker Render service configuration
- [x] Document all production worker service settings and specifications
- [x] Inventory all environment variables used by production worker service
- [x] Map service dependencies and external integrations
- [x] Document current resource allocations and performance metrics

**Phase 1 Status**: âœ… COMPLETED (January 21, 2025)
- Comprehensive audit documentation created in `service_replication/` directory
- All service configurations documented with detailed specifications
- Complete environment variables inventory with staging recommendations
- Service dependencies and external integrations fully mapped
- Resource allocations and performance metrics analyzed

## Phase 2: Staging Environment Planning
- [ ] Review existing staging database configuration from .env.staging
- [ ] Define staging-specific environment variable requirements for Render services
- [ ] Identify staging external service endpoints and integrations (excluding database)
- [ ] Plan staging domain and networking configurations for Render services
- [ ] Define staging-specific resource allocation requirements for API and worker services
- [ ] Create staging service naming and organization strategy

## Phase 3: Staging API Service Creation
- [ ] Create insurance-navigator-staging-api service via Render MCP
- [ ] Apply production API service configuration to staging service
- [ ] Configure staging-specific environment variables for API service (using existing .env.staging database config)
- [ ] Connect API service to existing staging database using .env.staging credentials
- [ ] Configure staging domain and networking for API service
- [ ] Validate staging API service health and basic functionality

## Phase 4: Staging Worker Service Creation
- [ ] Create insurance-navigator-staging-worker service via Render MCP
- [ ] Apply production worker service configuration to staging service
- [ ] Configure staging-specific environment variables for worker service (using existing .env.staging database config)
- [ ] Connect worker service to existing staging database using .env.staging credentials
- [ ] Configure staging external service integrations for worker
- [ ] Validate staging worker service health and job processing

## Phase 5: Service Integration and Communication
- [ ] Configure communication between staging API and worker services
- [ ] Validate inter-service communication in staging environment
- [ ] Test job queuing and processing between staging services
- [ ] Configure shared staging environment variables and configurations
- [ ] Validate staging service networking and security configurations

## Phase 6: Comprehensive Testing and Validation
- [ ] Run comprehensive health checks on all staging services
- [ ] Test basic API functionality in staging environment
- [ ] Test worker job processing capabilities in staging environment
- [ ] Validate staging environment variable loading and accessibility
- [ ] Perform load testing to establish staging performance baselines
- [ ] Validate staging service logging and monitoring configurations

## Phase 7: Configuration Documentation and Handoff
- [ ] Document all staging service configurations and settings
- [ ] Create staging environment variable reference documentation
- [ ] Document staging service endpoints and access information
- [ ] Create staging infrastructure troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Prepare staging infrastructure handoff documentation for research phase
- [ ] Validate staging infrastructure readiness for subsequent phases
