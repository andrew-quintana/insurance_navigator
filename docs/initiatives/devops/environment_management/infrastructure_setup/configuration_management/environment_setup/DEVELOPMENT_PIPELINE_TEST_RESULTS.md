# Development Pipeline Test Results

## Summary
We tested the development environment pipeline to verify user creation, document upload, chunk generation, and RAG search functionality.

## Test Results

### ✅ Working Components
1. **User Authentication**: 
   - User creation works correctly
   - User login works correctly
   - JWT token generation works

2. **Document Upload Initiation**:
   - Document upload endpoint (`/api/v2/upload`) works
   - Job creation works
   - Document ID generation works

3. **Worker Service**:
   - Worker status endpoint works
   - Worker is operational and connected to database

### ❌ Issues Found

1. **Document Content Upload**:
   - **Issue**: Signed URLs are still using incorrect domain `storage.supabase.co` instead of correct Supabase URL
   - **Status**: Fixed in code but not yet deployed to production
   - **Impact**: Prevents document content from being uploaded, blocking the entire pipeline

2. **RAG Functionality**:
   - **Issue**: RAG debug endpoint returns 500 - "RAG tool not available"
   - **Status**: RAG tools are not properly initialized
   - **Impact**: Cannot test RAG search functionality

3. **Chat Service**:
   - **Issue**: Chat endpoint returns 500 - "Chat service temporarily unavailable - missing required components"
   - **Status**: Chat service dependencies are missing
   - **Impact**: Cannot test chat functionality

4. **Document Service**:
   - **Issue**: DocumentService missing required `supabase_client` argument
   - **Status**: Service initialization issue
   - **Impact**: Cannot check document status

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue preventing the full pipeline from working is the **incorrect Supabase storage URL**. The API is generating signed URLs using `storage.supabase.co` which cannot be resolved, instead of the correct URL `https://your-project.supabase.co`.

### Fixes Applied
1. ✅ Updated `main.py` to use `SUPABASE_STORAGE_URL` environment variable
2. ✅ Updated `api/upload_pipeline/config.py` to load storage URL from environment
3. ✅ Updated `api/upload_pipeline/endpoints/upload.py` to prioritize `SUPABASE_STORAGE_URL`
4. ✅ Created `.env.production` file with correct Supabase URL
5. ✅ Fixed pgbouncer prepared statement issue with `statement_cache_size=0`

### Deployment Status
- ✅ Code changes committed and pushed
- ⏳ Waiting for production deployment to complete
- ⏳ Environment variable `SUPABASE_STORAGE_URL` needs to be set in production

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Wait for production deployment to complete
   - Set `SUPABASE_STORAGE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co` in production environment
   - Test document upload pipeline again

2. **Secondary Issues**:
   - Investigate RAG tool initialization issues
   - Fix chat service missing components
   - Resolve DocumentService supabase_client argument issue

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Once storage URL is fixed, test complete pipeline: user → upload → chunks → RAG
   - Verify similarity scores are above 0.3 threshold
   - Test with realistic insurance policy content

## Expected Pipeline Flow
1. User creates account ✅
2. User authenticates ✅
3. User uploads document ✅ (initiation)
4. Document content uploaded to storage ❌ (blocked by URL issue)
5. Worker processes document ❌ (blocked by step 4)
6. Chunks generated and stored ❌ (blocked by step 5)
7. RAG search works ❌ (blocked by step 6)
8. Chat responds with deductible info ❌ (blocked by step 7)

## Next Steps
1. Monitor production deployment
2. Set production environment variables
3. Re-test complete pipeline
4. Fix remaining service initialization issues
