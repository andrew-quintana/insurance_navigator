# Render Deployment Root Cause Analysis

**Date**: January 21, 2025  
**Service**: `api-service-staging` (srv-d3740ijuibrs738mus1g)  
**Issue**: Environment variables not being applied, application still running on port 8000  
**Status**: üîç **INVESTIGATING**  

## Executive Summary

Despite multiple attempts to configure environment variables through the Render API, the staging API service continues to run on port 8000 instead of the expected port 10000. This indicates a fundamental issue with how environment variables are being applied or read in the Render deployment environment.

## Previous Attempts Documentation

### **Attempt 1: Environment Variable Updates via MCP API**
- **Date**: 2025-09-20 21:21:18
- **Method**: `mcp_render_update_environment_variables`
- **Variables Set**: `API_HOST=0.0.0.0`, `PORT=10000`, `API_PORT=8000`
- **Deploy ID**: `dep-d37hljbe5dus739d6r30`
- **Result**: ‚ùå **FAILED** - `update_failed` status
- **Evidence**: Application still running on port 8000

### **Attempt 2: Second Environment Variable Update**
- **Date**: 2025-09-20 22:19:38
- **Method**: `mcp_render_update_environment_variables`
- **Variables Set**: `PORT=10000`, `API_HOST=0.0.0.0`, `API_PORT=8000`, `ENVIRONMENT=staging`
- **Deploy ID**: `dep-d37iguffte5s73bb1cq0`
- **Result**: üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** - Still building
- **Evidence**: Application still running on port 8000

### **Attempt 3: Code Changes with Debugging**
- **Date**: 2025-09-20 22:20:00
- **Method**: Added debugging output to `main.py`
- **Changes**: Environment variable logging, explicit port/host configuration
- **Result**: ‚úÖ **COMMITTED** - Changes pushed to main branch
- **Evidence**: Local testing confirms code works correctly

## Root Cause Analysis

### **Primary Hypothesis: Environment Variable Application Failure**

The consistent pattern of the application running on port 8000 despite setting `PORT=10000` suggests one of the following issues:

#### **1. Render Environment Variable Persistence Issue**
- **Theory**: Environment variables set via API are not persisting to the deployment
- **Evidence**: Multiple API calls to set variables, but no effect on application behavior
- **Likelihood**: **HIGH** - Most likely cause

#### **2. Docker Layer Caching Issue**
- **Theory**: Docker build is using cached layers that don't include environment variables
- **Evidence**: Application consistently uses default port 8000
- **Likelihood**: **MEDIUM** - Possible but less likely

#### **3. Render Platform Bug**
- **Theory**: Render platform has a bug with environment variable handling
- **Evidence**: Multiple failed attempts with different approaches
- **Likelihood**: **LOW** - Unlikely but possible

#### **4. Branch Mismatch Issue**
- **Theory**: Service is deploying from wrong branch or commit
- **Evidence**: Service configured for `deployment/cloud-infrastructure` branch
- **Likelihood**: **HIGH** - Very likely cause

### **Secondary Hypothesis: Deployment Configuration Issue**

#### **Branch Configuration Problem**
- **Service Branch**: `deployment/cloud-infrastructure`
- **Code Changes**: Made on `main` branch
- **Issue**: Service may not be deploying latest code with debugging changes
- **Evidence**: Service auto-deploy is disabled, manual triggers may not use latest code

## Evidence Analysis

### **What We Know Works**
1. ‚úÖ **Local Environment**: Application works correctly with `PORT=10000`
2. ‚úÖ **Code Logic**: Environment variable reading logic is correct
3. ‚úÖ **Dockerfile**: Uses `${PORT:-8000}` correctly
4. ‚úÖ **API Calls**: MCP API calls return success

### **What We Know Doesn't Work**
1. ‚ùå **Render Environment**: Variables not being applied to running application
2. ‚ùå **Port Binding**: Application consistently binds to port 8000
3. ‚ùå **Health Checks**: Service times out due to port mismatch

### **Critical Evidence**
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
==> Timed Out
```

This shows:
- Application is using hardcoded port 8000
- Environment variable `PORT=10000` is not being read
- Render expects service on port 10000 but gets 8000

## Investigation Methodology Issues

### **1. Incomplete Environment Variable Verification**
- **Problem**: We assumed API calls were successful without verifying actual deployment
- **Solution**: Need to verify environment variables are actually set in deployment

### **2. Branch Mismatch Not Addressed**
- **Problem**: Made changes on `main` but service deploys from `deployment/cloud-infrastructure`
- **Solution**: Need to merge changes to correct branch

### **3. Insufficient Logging**
- **Problem**: No visibility into what environment variables are actually available at runtime
- **Solution**: Added debugging code but need to verify it's deployed

## Corrective Action Plan

### **Phase 1: Immediate Verification**
1. **Check Current Deployment Status**
   - Verify which commit is being deployed
   - Check if debugging code is included
   - Review deployment logs for environment variable output

2. **Verify Environment Variables in Render Dashboard**
   - Check if variables are actually set in service configuration
   - Verify no conflicts or overrides

### **Phase 2: Branch Synchronization**
1. **Merge Changes to Deployment Branch**
   - Switch to `deployment/cloud-infrastructure` branch
   - Merge changes from `main` branch
   - Push to trigger new deployment

2. **Verify Branch Configuration**
   - Ensure service is configured to deploy from correct branch
   - Check if auto-deploy should be enabled

### **Phase 3: Alternative Deployment Methods**
1. **Manual Deployment via Render CLI**
   - Use `render services deploy` command
   - Verify environment variables are applied

2. **Direct Environment Variable Override**
   - Set variables directly in Render dashboard
   - Trigger manual deployment

## Expected Outcomes

### **Success Criteria**
- Application logs show: `Starting server on 0.0.0.0:10000`
- Health check returns 200 status
- Service accessible on port 10000

### **Failure Indicators**
- Application still runs on port 8000
- Environment variables not visible in logs
- Service continues to timeout

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Check current deployment status and logs
2. **Short-term**: Merge changes to deployment branch
3. **Medium-term**: Implement proper branch synchronization
4. **Long-term**: Establish robust deployment verification process
