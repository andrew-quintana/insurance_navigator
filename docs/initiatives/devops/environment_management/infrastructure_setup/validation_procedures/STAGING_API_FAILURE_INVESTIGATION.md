# Staging API Service Failure Investigation

**Date**: January 21, 2025  
**Service**: `api-service-staging` (srv-d3740ijuibrs738mus1g)  
**Issue**: API service failing to start with network connectivity error  
**Status**: üîç **INVESTIGATING**  

## Issue Summary

The staging API service is failing to start due to a network connectivity issue when attempting to connect to the Supabase database. The service initializes all components successfully but fails during database connection establishment.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Error Details
```
2025-09-20 19:07:25,501 - core.database - ERROR - Failed to initialize database pool: [Errno 101] Network is unreachable
2025-09-20 19:07:25,501 - core - ERROR - System initialization failed: [Errno 101] Network is unreachable
```

### Root Cause
The staging API service is experiencing the **same network connectivity issue** as the staging worker service. This is a **Render platform network restriction** preventing outbound connections to external databases.

### Database Connection Details
- **Target**: `db.your-project.supabase.co:5432`
- **Error**: `[Errno 101] Network is unreachable`
- **Connection Type**: Direct database connection (not pooler)

### Timeline of Events

#### 19:07:25 - Service Initialization
```
2025-09-20 19:07:25,016 - Resilience systems initialized successfully
2025-09-20 19:07:25,017 - Registered degradation managers: ['rag', 'upload', 'database']
2025-09-20 19:07:25,017 - Registered circuit breakers: ['service_database', 'service_rag']
```

#### 19:07:25 - Database Initialization Attempt
```
2025-09-20 19:07:25,498 - core.database - INFO - Initializing database pool: db.your-project.supabase.co:5432
2025-09-20 19:07:25,501 - core.database - ERROR - Failed to initialize database pool: [Errno 101] Network is unreachable
```

#### 19:07:25 - System Shutdown
```
2025-09-20 19:07:25,501 - core - ERROR - System initialization failed: [Errno 101] Network is unreachable
2025-09-20 19:07:25,501 - core - INFO - Shutting down Insurance Navigator system
2025-09-20 19:07:25,501 - main - ERROR - Failed to initialize system: [Errno 101] Network is unreachable
```

**Status**: ‚ùå **FAILED** - Same network connectivity issue as worker service

## Evidence Analysis

### 1. Service Initialization Success
- ‚úÖ Resilience systems initialized
- ‚úÖ Circuit breakers created
- ‚úÖ Service managers registered
- ‚úÖ All core components loaded

### 2. Database Connection Failure
- ‚ùå Direct database connection fails
- ‚ùå Network unreachable error
- ‚ùå Service shutdown triggered

### 3. Error Pattern Consistency
This is **identical** to the staging worker service issue:
- Same error: `[Errno 101] Network is unreachable`
- Same target: Supabase database
- Same root cause: Render platform network restrictions

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause
**Render Platform Network Restrictions**: Render's infrastructure is blocking outbound connections to external databases, specifically Supabase.

### Contributing Factors
1. **Direct Database URL**: Using direct connection instead of pooler
2. **Network Policies**: Render may have firewall rules preventing external DB connections
3. **IP Whitelisting**: Supabase may require IP whitelisting for Render services
4. **Regional Routing**: Network routing issues between Render and Supabase

### Evidence Supporting Network Restriction Theory
1. **Consistent Error**: Both API and worker services fail with identical error
2. **Local Connectivity**: Database works from local machine
3. **Service Initialization**: All other components initialize successfully
4. **Error Code**: `[Errno 101] Network is unreachable` is a network-level error

## Issue Comparison with Worker Service

### Worker Service Issues (RESOLVED)
The worker service had **TWO sequential issues**:
1. **Configuration Error**: `invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1.0'` - ‚úÖ **FIXED**
2. **Network Connectivity**: `[Errno 101] Network is unreachable` - ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** (using pooler URL)

### API Service Issues (CURRENT)
The API service has **ONE issue** (same as worker's second issue):
1. **Network Connectivity**: `[Errno 101] Network is unreachable` - üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** (updating to pooler URL)

### Key Differences
- **Configuration Issues**: Worker had integer conversion error, API did not
- **Network Issues**: Both services had identical network connectivity problems
- **Resolution Status**: Worker resolved, API currently being fixed
- **Database URL**: Both need pooler URL instead of direct connection

## Impact Assessment

### Service Impact
- **API Service**: ‚ùå Completely unavailable (502 errors)
- **Worker Service**: ‚úÖ Working (uses pooler URL)
- **Database**: ‚úÖ Accessible from local machine
- **User Experience**: ‚ùå Staging environment non-functional

### Business Impact
- **Development**: Staging environment unavailable for testing
- **Deployment**: Cannot validate changes before production
- **Integration**: Inter-service communication blocked

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Update API Service Database URL
**Current**: `db.your-project.supabase.co:5432` (direct)  
**Required**: `aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543` (pooler)

### 2. Verify Environment Variables
Check that the staging API service is using the correct database URL configuration.

### 3. Test Connection
Verify that the pooler URL works for the API service.

## Corrective Actions

### Immediate Fix
1. **Update Database URL**: Change from direct to pooler URL
2. **Redeploy Service**: Trigger new deployment with corrected configuration
3. **Verify Startup**: Confirm service starts successfully

### Long-term Solutions
1. **IP Whitelisting**: Add Render IP ranges to Supabase allowlist
2. **Network Configuration**: Review Render's network settings
3. **Alternative Connection**: Consider using Supabase REST API
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for network connectivity issues

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Configuration Validation
- Add database connectivity tests to CI/CD pipeline
- Validate environment variables before deployment
- Test both direct and pooler URLs

### 2. Network Monitoring
- Monitor database connection health
- Set up alerts for network connectivity issues
- Track connection success rates

### 3. Documentation
- Document network requirements and restrictions
- Create troubleshooting guides for connectivity issues
- Maintain list of known network limitations

## Expected Resolution

After applying the corrective actions:
1. **API Service**: Should start successfully and connect to database
2. **Health Checks**: Should return 200 status
3. **Inter-Service Communication**: Should work with worker service
4. **Staging Environment**: Should be fully functional

## Next Steps

1. **Update Configuration**: Change database URL to pooler
2. **Redeploy Service**: Trigger new deployment
3. **Monitor Startup**: Watch logs for successful initialization
4. **Test Functionality**: Verify API endpoints work correctly
5. **Update Documentation**: Document the network restriction issue
