# Staging Worker Service Failure Investigation

**Date**: January 21, 2025  
**Service**: `upload-worker-staging` (srv-d37dlmvfte5s73b6uq0g)  
**Issue**: Worker service failing to start with configuration error  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  

## Issue Summary

The staging worker service was failing to start due to a type conversion error in the worker configuration. The service would start, validate imports, load environment variables, but then crash during configuration initialization.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Error Details
```
ERROR - Failed to start enhanced worker runner: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1.0'
```

### Root Cause
The `WORKER_RETRY_BASE_DELAY` environment variable was set to `'1.0'` (string), but the worker configuration code was attempting to convert it directly to an integer using `int()`.

### Code Location
The error occurs in the worker configuration initialization where the retry base delay is processed:

```python
# In worker configuration
retry_base_delay = int(os.getenv('WORKER_RETRY_BASE_DELAY', '1'))
```

### Environment Variable Issue
- **Set Value**: `WORKER_RETRY_BASE_DELAY=1.0` (string with decimal)
- **Expected**: Integer value
- **Problem**: `int('1.0')` fails because Python's `int()` doesn't handle decimal strings

2025-09-20 18:33:28,514 - __main__ - ERROR - Failed to start enhanced worker runner: [Errno 101] Network is unreachable
```

### 18:36:27 - Pooler URL Also Failing
```
2025-09-20 18:36:27,733 - enhanced_base_worker.f21ad399-4a4e-41c4-a47d-037548a97233 - CRITICAL - ALERT: Error threshold exceeded for CONFIGURATION_ERROR_FATAL
2025-09-20 18:36:27,733 - __main__ - ERROR - Failed to start enhanced worker runner: [Errno 101] Network is unreachable
```

**Status**: ✅ Configuration error resolved, ❌ Network connectivity issue (both direct and pooler URLs failing)

## Resolution Applied

### Environment Variable Fix
**Before**:
```bash
WORKER_RETRY_BASE_DELAY=1.0
```

**After**:
```bash
WORKER_RETRY_BASE_DELAY=1
```

### Additional Integer Variables Fixed
```bash
WORKER_POLL_INTERVAL=5
WORKER_MAX_RETRIES=3
OPENAI_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=3500
OPENAI_TOKENS_PER_MINUTE=90000
OPENAI_MAX_BATCH_SIZE=256
FAILURE_THRESHOLD=5
RECOVERY_TIMEOUT=60
```

### Deployment Status
- **Deploy ID**: `dep-d37f6efdiees73a6s61g` (Configuration fix)
- **Deploy ID**: `dep-d37f800gjchc73c86hg0` (Pooler URL attempt)
- **Status**: ✅ Configuration error resolved
- **New Issue**: Network connectivity problem (both direct and pooler URLs failing)

## Validation Steps

### 1. Monitor Deployment
- Watch for successful deployment completion
- Verify worker service starts without errors
- Check logs for successful initialization

### 2. Test Worker Functionality
- Verify worker can connect to database
- Test job polling functionality
- Validate job processing capabilities

### 3. End-to-End Testing
- Test job creation from API service
- Verify worker picks up and processes jobs
- Validate job status updates

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Environment Variable Validation
- Implement type validation for numeric environment variables
- Add configuration validation before service startup
- Use proper type conversion with error handling

### 2. Configuration Testing
- Test worker configuration in staging before production
- Validate all environment variables during deployment
- Add configuration validation to CI/CD pipeline

### 3. Error Handling Improvements
- Add better error messages for configuration issues
- Implement graceful degradation for invalid configurations
- Add configuration validation logging

## Code Improvement Recommendations

### Current Code (Problematic)
```python
retry_base_delay = int(os.getenv('WORKER_RETRY_BASE_DELAY', '1'))
```

### Improved Code (Recommended)
```python
try:
    retry_base_delay = float(os.getenv('WORKER_RETRY_BASE_DELAY', '1'))
    retry_base_delay = int(retry_base_delay) if retry_base_delay.is_integer() else retry_base_delay
except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:
    logger.error(f"Invalid WORKER_RETRY_BASE_DELAY value: {os.getenv('WORKER_RETRY_BASE_DELAY')}. Using default: 1")
    retry_base_delay = 1
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Worker service startup success rate
- Configuration validation errors
- Worker job processing rate
- Database connection health

### Alerts to Set Up
- Worker service startup failures
- Configuration validation errors
- Worker job processing stalls
- Database connection failures

## Network Connectivity Issue Analysis

### Problem Description
The staging worker service is experiencing persistent network connectivity issues when attempting to connect to the Supabase database. Both direct database URLs and pooler URLs fail with `[Errno 101] Network is unreachable`.

### Evidence
1. **Local Connectivity**: ✅ Database connection works from local machine
2. **Direct URL**: ❌ `postgresql://postgres:beqhar-qincyg-Syxxi8@db.your-project.supabase.co:5432/postgres`
3. **Pooler URL**: ❌ `${DATABASE_URL}/Proxy**: Set up network tunneling if allowed by Render

## Expected Resolution

After resolving the network connectivity issue:
1. **Worker Service**: Should start successfully and connect to database
2. **Job Processing**: Should be able to poll and process jobs from database
3. **Inter-Service Communication**: Should work correctly with API service
4. **Monitoring**: Should show healthy worker status

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Deployment**: Wait for deployment to complete
2. **Verify Worker Health**: Check worker service logs for successful startup
3. **Test Job Processing**: Validate worker can process jobs from database
4. **Update Documentation**: Document the configuration requirements
5. **Implement Prevention**: Add configuration validation to prevent similar issues

**Investigation Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Resolution Applied**: Environment variable type fix  
**Expected Resolution Time**: 2-3 minutes  
**Prevention**: Configuration validation improvements recommended
