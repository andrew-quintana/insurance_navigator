# Root Cause Resolution: Branch Mismatch Issue

**Date**: January 21, 2025  
**Service**: `api-service-staging` (srv-d3740ijuibrs738mus1g)  
**Issue**: Environment variables not being applied  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**  

## Root Cause Identified

### **Primary Cause: Branch Mismatch**
The staging API service was configured to deploy from the `deployment/cloud-infrastructure` branch, but all our debugging changes and environment variable fixes were made on the `main` branch.

### **Evidence**
- **Service Branch**: `deployment/cloud-infrastructure`
- **Deployed Commit**: `9ae03d8` (September 20th)
- **Latest Main Commit**: `1a0e11f` (January 21st)
- **Gap**: 4+ months of changes not deployed

### **Why Environment Variables Weren't Working**
1. **Old Code**: Service was running old code without environment variable debugging
2. **Missing Changes**: Dockerfile updates and main.py debugging code not deployed
3. **Stale Configuration**: Environment variables were set but code couldn't use them

## Resolution Applied

### **Step 1: Branch Synchronization**
```bash
# Switched to deployment branch
git checkout deployment/cloud-infrastructure

# Merged latest changes from main
git merge main

# Pushed to trigger new deployment
git push origin deployment/cloud-infrastructure
```

### **Step 2: Changes Now Deployed**
- ✅ **Debugging Code**: Environment variable logging in main.py
- ✅ **Dockerfile Updates**: Dynamic port configuration
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Set in Render dashboard
- ✅ **Latest Code**: All recent fixes and improvements

## Expected Outcome

With the correct code now deployed, we should see:

### **Debug Output in Logs**
```
=== Environment Variables Debug ===
PORT: 10000
API_HOST: 0.0.0.0
API_PORT: 8000
ENVIRONMENT: staging
=== Starting server on 0.0.0.0:10000 ===
```

### **Service Behavior**
- ✅ Application binds to port 10000
- ✅ Health checks pass
- ✅ Service accessible on correct port

## Lessons Learned

### **1. Branch Management**
- **Issue**: Service deployed from different branch than development
- **Solution**: Always verify which branch service deploys from
- **Prevention**: Document branch configuration for each service

### **2. Deployment Verification**
- **Issue**: Assumed code changes were deployed
- **Solution**: Verify actual deployed commit matches expected
- **Prevention**: Check deployment logs for commit hashes

### **3. Environment Variable Testing**
- **Issue**: Set variables but didn't verify they were being read
- **Solution**: Added debugging output to verify variable reading
- **Prevention**: Always include debugging for critical configuration

## Prevention Measures

### **1. Branch Synchronization Process**
- Regularly sync deployment branches with main
- Document which branch each service uses
- Verify deployments use latest code

### **2. Deployment Verification**
- Check deployed commit hash matches expected
- Verify environment variables in deployment logs
- Test service functionality after deployment

### **3. Configuration Management**
- Centralize environment variable management
- Document all service configurations
- Implement configuration validation

**Resolution Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Root Cause**: Branch mismatch preventing latest code deployment  
**Next Action**: Monitor new deployment for successful startup
