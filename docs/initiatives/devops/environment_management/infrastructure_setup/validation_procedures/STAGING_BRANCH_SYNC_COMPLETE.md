# Staging Branch Sync Complete

**Date**: January 21, 2025  
**Service**: `api-service-staging` (srv-d3740ijuibrs738mus1g)  
**Action**: Synchronized staging branch with latest code  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**  

## Actions Taken

### **1. Branch Configuration Verified**
- **Service Branch**: `staging` ✅
- **Previous Branch**: `deployment/cloud-infrastructure` (incorrect)
- **Current Status**: Service now correctly configured for `staging` branch

### **2. Code Synchronization**
```bash
# Switched to staging branch
git checkout staging

# Merged latest changes from main
git merge main

# Pushed to remote staging branch
git push origin staging
```

### **3. Changes Now Available**
- ✅ **Debugging Code**: Environment variable logging in main.py
- ✅ **Dockerfile Updates**: Dynamic port configuration with `${PORT:-8000}`
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Set in Render dashboard
- ✅ **Latest Code**: All recent fixes and improvements

## Current Status

### **Service Configuration**
- **Branch**: `staging` ✅
- **Auto Deploy**: `no` (manual deployment required)
- **Environment Variables**: Set (`PORT=10000`, `API_HOST=0.0.0.0`)
- **Port Configuration**: 10000 ✅

### **Code Status**
- **Staging Branch**: Up to date with latest changes
- **Commit**: `1a0e11f` (includes debugging code)
- **Ready for Deployment**: ✅

## Next Steps Required

### **Manual Deployment Required**
Since `autoDeploy: "no"`, you need to manually trigger deployment:

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d3740ijuibrs738mus1g
2. **Click "Manual Deploy"** or **"Deploy Latest Commit"**
3. **Wait for deployment** to complete (5-10 minutes)

### **Expected Deployment Behavior**
Once deployed, you should see in the logs:
```
=== Environment Variables Debug ===
PORT: 10000
API_HOST: 0.0.0.0
API_PORT: 8000
ENVIRONMENT: staging
=== Starting server on 0.0.0.0:10000 ===
```

### **Success Indicators**
- ✅ Application starts on port 10000 (not 8000)
- ✅ Health checks pass
- ✅ Service accessible and functional
- ✅ Debug output visible in logs

## Root Cause Resolution Summary

### **Original Problem**
- Service was deploying from wrong branch (`deployment/cloud-infrastructure`)
- Code was 4+ months old without environment variable fixes
- Environment variables were set but couldn't be used by old code

### **Resolution Applied**
- ✅ **Branch Correction**: Service now deploys from `staging` branch
- ✅ **Code Sync**: Latest changes merged to staging branch
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Already configured in Render
- ✅ **Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging

### **Prevention Measures**
- **Branch Management**: Document which branch each service uses
- **Deployment Verification**: Always check deployed commit hash
- **Environment Testing**: Include debugging for critical configuration

---

**Sync Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Next Action**: Manual deployment trigger required  
**Expected Outcome**: Service should run on port 10000 with full functionality
