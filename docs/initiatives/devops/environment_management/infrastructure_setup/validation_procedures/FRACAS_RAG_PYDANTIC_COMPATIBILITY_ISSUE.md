# FRACAS: RAG System Pydantic Compatibility Issue

## Incident Summary
**Date:** 2025-09-22  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** OPEN  
**Component:** RAG System / OpenAI Embeddings  
**Impact:** RAG functionality completely broken - no document retrieval possible

## Problem Description
The RAG system is failing to generate embeddings due to a Pydantic version compatibility issue. The error indicates that field names with leading underscores are not allowed in the current Pydantic version.

### Error Details
```
2025-09-22 12:14:07,754 - RAGTool - ERROR - OpenAI embedding generation failed: Fields must not use names with leading underscores; e.g., use 'pydantic_extra__' instead of '__pydantic_extra__'.
2025-09-22 12:14:07,755 - RAGTool - ERROR - RAGTool text retrieval error: Failed to generate query embedding: Fields must not use names with leading underscores; e.g., use 'pydantic_extra__' instead of '__pydantic_extra__'.
```

### Root Cause Analysis
This is a **Pydantic version compatibility issue** where:
1. The current Pydantic version (2.5.0) has stricter field naming rules
2. Some dependency (likely OpenAI client or related library) is using field names with leading underscores
3. This breaks the embedding generation process in the RAG system

## Impact Assessment
- **User Impact:** HIGH - No document retrieval functionality
- **System Impact:** HIGH - RAG system completely non-functional
- **Business Impact:** HIGH - Core AI functionality unavailable

## Immediate Actions Taken
1. ✅ Identified the error in production logs
2. ✅ Created FRACAS item for tracking
3. ✅ Prepared resolution prompt

## Resolution Strategy
The issue requires either:
1. **Requirements Update**: Downgrade Pydantic to compatible version
2. **Code Update**: Update OpenAI client usage to be compatible with Pydantic 2.5.0
3. **Dependency Update**: Update OpenAI client to newer version that's compatible

## Next Steps
1. Execute the resolution prompt to determine the best approach
2. Test the fix in development environment
3. Deploy fix to production
4. Monitor RAG system functionality

## Resolution Status
- [x] Root cause identified
- [x] Solution implemented
- [x] Testing completed
- [x] Production deployment
- [ ] Monitoring confirmed

## Resolution Details
**Solution:** Downgrade Pydantic from 2.5.0 to 2.4.0
**Commit:** 0eddf45
**Reason:** Pydantic 2.5.0 has stricter field naming rules that break OpenAI client compatibility

### Root Cause
Pydantic 2.5.0 introduced stricter validation rules that reject field names with leading underscores (e.g., `__pydantic_extra__`). The OpenAI client library uses these field names internally, causing the embedding generation to fail.

### Resolution
- Downgraded Pydantic from 2.5.0 to 2.4.0 in `requirements-api.txt`
- This version is compatible with OpenAI client 1.108.1
- RAG system now works properly without Pydantic validation errors

### Testing
- ✅ Application imports successfully with Pydantic 2.4.0
- ✅ No Pydantic validation errors
- ✅ RAG system functionality restored
