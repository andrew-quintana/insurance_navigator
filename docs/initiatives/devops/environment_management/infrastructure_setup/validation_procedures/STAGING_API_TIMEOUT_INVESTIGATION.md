# Staging API Service Timeout Investigation

**Date**: January 21, 2025  
**Service**: `api-service-staging` (srv-d3740ijuibrs738mus1g)  
**Issue**: Recurring deployment timeout after successful startup  
**Status**: üîç **INVESTIGATING**  

## Issue Summary

The staging API service is experiencing recurring timeout issues during deployment. The service successfully initializes all components, starts up completely, and runs normally, but then times out after approximately 12 minutes of operation, causing Render to terminate the deployment.

## Root Cause Analysis

**Duration**: 12 minutes 5 seconds (19:52:52 to 20:04:57)

## Evidence Analysis

### 1. Service Initialization ‚úÖ
- All services initialized successfully
- Database pool connected (5-20 connections)
- Resilience systems operational
- Health monitoring active

### 2. Application Startup ‚úÖ
- FastAPI application started successfully
- Uvicorn server running on port 8000
- All core services registered
- System monitoring active

### 3. Runtime Operation ‚úÖ
- Service ran normally for ~12 minutes
- No error logs during runtime
- No health check failures
- No service degradation

### 4. Timeout Event ‚ùå
- Render platform timeout after 12 minutes
- No application errors before timeout
- Graceful shutdown initiated after timeout

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause
**Render Platform Timeout**: The service is being terminated by Render's platform timeout mechanism, not due to application errors.

### Contributing Factors
1. **Health Check Configuration**: Missing or misconfigured health check endpoint
2. **Port Configuration**: Service running on port 8000 but Render expects port 10000
3. **Startup Time**: Service may be taking too long to respond to health checks
4. **Resource Constraints**: Possible memory or CPU limits being exceeded

### Evidence Supporting Platform Timeout Theory
1. **No Application Errors**: Service ran without errors for 12 minutes
2. **Graceful Shutdown**: Service shut down cleanly after timeout
3. **Render Timeout Message**: Explicit "Timed Out" message from Render platform
4. **Consistent Pattern**: Similar to previous timeout issues

## Configuration Analysis

### Current Service Configuration
- **Port**: 8000 (application)
- **Expected Port**: 10000 (Render configuration)
- **Health Check**: Not configured
- **Plan**: Starter (limited resources)

### Port Mismatch Issue
The service is running on port 8000 but Render is configured to expect port 10000:
- **Application**: `Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000`
- **Render Config**: `"openPorts":[{"port":10000,"protocol":"TCP"}]`

## Impact Assessment

### Service Impact
- **API Service**: ‚ùå Unavailable due to timeouts
- **Staging Environment**: ‚ùå Non-functional
- **Development Workflow**: ‚ùå Blocked

### Business Impact
- **Testing**: Cannot validate changes in staging
- **Deployment**: Cannot test before production
- **Integration**: Inter-service communication blocked

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Fix Port Configuration
**Current**: Application running on port 8000  
**Required**: Application must run on port 10000 to match Render configuration

### 2. Configure Health Check
**Current**: No health check configured  
**Required**: Add health check endpoint for Render monitoring

### 3. Verify Resource Limits
**Current**: Starter plan (limited resources)  
**Required**: Ensure service fits within plan limits

## Corrective Actions

### Immediate Fix
1. **Update Port Configuration**: Change application to run on port 10000 ‚úÖ **APPLIED**
2. **Add Health Check**: Configure health check endpoint ‚úÖ **APPLIED**
3. **Redeploy Service**: Trigger new deployment with corrected configuration ‚úÖ **APPLIED**

### Actions Taken
1. **Code Fix**: Updated `main.py` to use `PORT` environment variable instead of hardcoded port 8000
2. **Environment Variables**: Set `PORT=10000` and `HEALTH_CHECK_PATH=/health` for staging service
3. **Deployment**: Triggered new deployment (dep-d37gsr6r433s73eola7g) with corrected configuration

### Long-term Solutions
1. **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor memory and CPU usage
2. **Health Check Validation**: Ensure health checks respond quickly
3. **Timeout Configuration**: Review Render timeout settings
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize startup time and resource usage

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Configuration Validation
- Validate port configuration matches Render settings
- Ensure health check endpoint is accessible
- Test service startup time locally

### 2. Monitoring Setup
- Monitor resource usage during deployment
- Set up alerts for timeout events
- Track health check response times

### 3. Documentation
- Document port configuration requirements
- Create troubleshooting guide for timeout issues
- Maintain deployment checklist

## Expected Resolution

After applying the corrective actions:
1. **Port Configuration**: Service should run on port 10000
2. **Health Check**: Render should receive health check responses
3. **Timeout Prevention**: Service should not timeout during deployment
4. **Staging Environment**: Should be fully functional

## Next Steps

1. **Update Port Configuration**: Change application port to 10000
2. **Add Health Check**: Configure health check endpoint
3. **Redeploy Service**: Trigger new deployment
4. **Monitor Deployment**: Watch for successful startup
5. **Test Functionality**: Verify API endpoints work correctly

## Comparison with Previous Issues

### Previous Timeout (17:55)
- **Cause**: Database connectivity issues
- **Resolution**: Fixed database configuration
- **Status**: Resolved

### Current Timeout (20:04)
- **Cause**: Port configuration mismatch
- **Resolution**: Fix port and health check configuration
- **Status**: In progress

**Investigation Status**: üîç **INVESTIGATING**  
**Root Cause**: Port configuration mismatch and missing health check  
**Expected Resolution Time**: 10-15 minutes  
**Priority**: **HIGH** - Staging environment unavailable
