# FRACAS Item: Chat Response Contamination

## üö® **INCIDENT SUMMARY**

**Date**: 2025-09-22  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Status**: INVESTIGATING  
**Component**: Chat Interface / Response Processing  

### **Problem Description**
The chat interface is returning contaminated responses where subsequent questions receive answers from previous questions. Specifically:

- **Question 1**: "How do I get access to an x-ray?" ‚Üí Returns x-ray response ‚úÖ
- **Question 2**: "Why is my PCP charging $5 each session? What is my copay?" ‚Üí Returns x-ray response ‚ùå

This indicates variable contamination or state persistence between chat requests.

### **Impact Assessment**
- **User Experience**: SEVERE - Users receive incorrect information
- **System Reliability**: HIGH - Core functionality compromised
- **Data Integrity**: MEDIUM - Response accuracy affected
- **Business Impact**: HIGH - Trust and usability issues

### **Root Cause Analysis**

#### **Suspected Causes**
1. **Variable Contamination**: Global variables not being reset between requests
2. **State Persistence**: Chat state carrying over between conversations
3. **Memory Leak**: Previous responses cached in memory
4. **Agent State**: Agent instances not properly isolated
5. **RAG Context**: RAG tool maintaining previous query context

#### **Investigation Areas**
- [ ] Chat interface state management
- [ ] Agent instance isolation
- [ ] RAG tool context cleanup
- [ ] Response processing pipeline
- [ ] Memory management and cleanup

### **Investigation Steps**

#### **Step 1: Check Chat Interface State Management**
```python
# Check if chat interface maintains state between requests
# Look for global variables or class-level state
```

#### **Step 2: Verify Agent Isolation**
```python
# Ensure each request gets fresh agent instances
# Check for singleton patterns or shared state
```

#### **Step 3: RAG Tool Context Cleanup**
```python
# Verify RAG tool resets context between requests
# Check for cached embeddings or query context
```

#### **Step 4: Response Processing Pipeline**
```python
# Check if response processing maintains state
# Look for cached responses or template reuse
```

### **Test Cases**

#### **Test 1: Sequential Different Questions**
1. Ask: "How do I get access to an x-ray?"
2. Ask: "What is my copay for doctor visits?"
3. Verify: Second response is about copays, not x-rays

#### **Test 2: Same Question Twice**
1. Ask: "What is my deductible?" (twice)
2. Verify: Both responses are about deductibles

#### **Test 3: Rapid Sequential Requests**
1. Send multiple different questions rapidly
2. Verify: Each response matches its question

### **Expected Resolution**
- [ ] Each chat request is completely isolated
- [ ] No state contamination between requests
- [ ] Responses accurately match the questions asked
- [ ] Memory is properly cleaned up between requests

### **Priority**
**HIGH** - This affects core functionality and user experience

### **Assigned To**
Development Team

### **Due Date**
2025-09-22 (Same day)
