# FRACAS: Chat Interface Import Failure

## 1. INCIDENT SUMMARY

**Date:** 2025-09-22  
**Time:** 11:40:32 UTC  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** OPEN  
**Component:** Chat Interface / Main Application  
**Environment:** Production  

### 1.1 Error Details
```
2025-09-22 11:40:32,151 - main - ERROR - Failed to import required chat interface classes
INFO:     10.220.19.150:47518 - "POST /chat HTTP/1.1" 500 Internal Server Error
```

### 1.2 Impact Assessment
- **User Impact:** Chat functionality completely unavailable
- **Service Impact:** HTTP 500 errors on `/chat` endpoint
- **Business Impact:** Core application feature non-functional
- **Affected Users:** All users attempting to use chat interface

## 2. INITIAL INVESTIGATION

### 2.1 Error Analysis
- **Error Type:** ImportError during application startup
- **Location:** Main application module
- **Trigger:** POST request to `/chat` endpoint
- **Pattern:** Consistent failure on chat interface initialization

### 2.2 Root Cause Hypothesis
Based on recent changes to requirements separation, likely causes:
1. **Missing Dependencies:** Chat interface classes require dependencies not included in `requirements-api.txt`
2. **Import Path Issues:** Incorrect import paths after requirements restructuring
3. **Circular Import Dependencies:** Import conflicts introduced by separated requirements
4. **Missing Environment Variables:** Required configuration not available at runtime

### 2.3 Recent Changes Context
- **Commit 99a9f6a:** Fixed missing pgvector dependency in worker requirements
- **Commit f6a0663:** Fixed critical worker deployment issues
- **Commit 7099c4a:** Separated requirements by service type
- **Potential Impact:** Requirements separation may have removed dependencies needed by chat interface

## 3. INVESTIGATION PROMPT FOR NEXT CHAT

### 3.1 Primary Investigation Tasks
1. **Identify Missing Dependencies**
   - Check what dependencies the chat interface classes require
   - Compare with current `requirements-api.txt` contents
   - Identify any missing packages that were removed during requirements separation

2. **Analyze Import Structure**
   - Examine the chat interface import statements in `main.py`
   - Check for circular import dependencies
   - Verify import paths are correct after recent restructuring

3. **Test Import Resolution**
   - Create a minimal test script to isolate the failing import
   - Test each import individually to identify the specific failure point
   - Check if the issue is environment-specific or code-related

4. **Check Environment Configuration**
   - Verify all required environment variables are set
   - Check if the issue is related to missing configuration
   - Test with different environment configurations

### 3.2 Specific Files to Investigate
- `main.py` - Main application entry point
- `requirements-api.txt` - Current API service dependencies
- `requirements.txt` - Original unified requirements (for comparison)
- Chat interface modules (location to be determined)
- Any recent changes to import statements

### 3.3 Expected Resolution Steps
1. **Immediate Fix:** Add missing dependencies to `requirements-api.txt`
2. **Code Fix:** Resolve any import path issues
3. **Testing:** Verify chat functionality works end-to-end
4. **Deployment:** Deploy fix to production
5. **Monitoring:** Ensure no regression in other functionality

### 3.4 Success Criteria
- Chat interface imports successfully without errors
- `/chat` endpoint returns 200 OK responses
- No regression in other application functionality
- All tests pass with separated requirements

## 4. TECHNICAL CONTEXT

### 4.1 Application Architecture
- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **Main Module:** `main.py`
- **Requirements:** Separated into `requirements-api.txt`, `requirements-worker.txt`, `requirements-testing.txt`
- **Deployment:** Render.com production environment

### 4.2 Recent Changes Impact
The requirements separation (commit 7099c4a) may have inadvertently removed dependencies needed by the chat interface. The error suggests that required chat interface classes cannot be imported, which is likely due to missing dependencies that were present in the original unified `requirements.txt` but not included in the new `requirements-api.txt`.

### 4.3 Error Pattern
- **Consistent:** Error occurs on every POST to `/chat`
- **Startup Related:** Import failure suggests module-level issue
- **Production Only:** May be environment-specific (needs verification)

## 5. NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate:** Investigate missing dependencies for chat interface
2. **Short-term:** Fix import issues and test locally
3. **Medium-term:** Deploy fix and monitor for stability
4. **Long-term:** Review requirements separation to prevent similar issues

## 6. ASSIGNMENT

**Assigned To:** Next available AI assistant  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours  
**Dependencies:** Access to codebase, ability to test locally and deploy
