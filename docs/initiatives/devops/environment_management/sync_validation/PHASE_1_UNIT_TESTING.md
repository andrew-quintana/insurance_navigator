# Phase 1: Unit Testing - Todo Document

**Created:** 2025-09-23 15:00:02 PDT

## Overview
This phase focuses on individual component and function-level testing to ensure core functionality works in isolation across development and staging environments.

## Phase 1 Todo List

- [ ] Identify and test edge cases
- [ ] Test error conditions and exceptions
- [ ] Validate test data integrity
- [ ] Document test results and findings

### 10. Test Environment Comparison
- [ ] Compare test results between development and staging
- [ ] Identify environment-specific test failures
- [ ] Document configuration differences affecting tests
- [ ] Validate test consistency across environments
- [ ] Create environment-specific test configurations
- [ ] Address any environment-specific issues
- [ ] Update documentation with environment differences

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All unit tests pass in development environment
- [ ] All unit tests pass in staging environment
- [ ] Test coverage exceeds 90% on core modules
- [ ] No critical issues identified during testing
- [ ] Test execution time is within acceptable limits
- [ ] Test results are consistent across environments
- [ ] All identified issues are documented and tracked

## Dependencies
