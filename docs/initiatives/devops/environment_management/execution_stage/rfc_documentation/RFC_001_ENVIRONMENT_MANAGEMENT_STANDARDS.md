# RFC 001: Environment Management Standards

## Status
**Draft** | Under Review | Accepted | Implemented

## Summary
This RFC establishes standardized patterns for environment management across the insurance_navigator application, ensuring consistent behavior across development, staging, and production environments.

## Motivation
The current codebase has inconsistent environment handling, making it difficult to:
- Transition code between environments reliably
- Test environment-specific configurations
- Maintain configuration consistency
- Prevent production deployment of untested code

## Detailed Design

### Environment Variable Standards
1. **Naming Convention**: `ENVIRONMENT_COMPONENT_SETTING` format
2. **Required Variables**: All environments must define the same set of variables
3. **File Structure**: 
   - `.env.development` - Development environment
   - `.env.staging` - Staging environment  
   - `.env.production` - Production environment
4. **No Defaults**: All environment variables must be explicitly defined

### Code Standards
1. **No Hardcoded Values**: All environment-specific values must come from environment variables
2. **Environment Detection**: Use `NODE_ENV` or equivalent for environment detection
3. **Configuration Loading**: Centralized configuration loading with validation
4. **Conditional Logic**: Minimize environment-specific conditional logic

### Deployment Workflow
1. **Development First**: All changes start in development environment
2. **Staging Validation**: Changes must pass staging environment testing
3. **Production Promotion**: Only staging-validated changes deploy to production
4. **No Direct Production**: No direct development-to-production deployments

### Testing Requirements
1. **Environment Parity**: Test configurations across all environments
2. **Configuration Validation**: Automated validation of environment variables
3. **Integration Testing**: Test environment transitions in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Rollback Procedures**: Clear rollback procedures for each environment

## Implementation Plan
Implementation will follow the phases defined in the execution stage planning documents.

## Alternatives Considered
- Single environment configuration with overrides
- Runtime environment detection without separate files
- Manual environment promotion processes

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Configuration drift between environments
  - **Mitigation**: Automated validation and standardized templates
- **Risk**: Deployment complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Automated deployment procedures and validation
