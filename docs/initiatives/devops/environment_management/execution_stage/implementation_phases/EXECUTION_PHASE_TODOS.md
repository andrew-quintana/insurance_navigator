# Execution Stage - Phased Todo List

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Implementation
- [ ] Create central configuration system in `shared/config/`
- [ ] Implement EnvironmentConfig class with validation
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for all configuration types
- [ ] Set up environment variable validation schema
- [ ] Create `.env.example` template with all required variables
- [ ] Implement configuration error handling and logging

## Phase 2: Staging Infrastructure Integration
- [ ] Validate staging infrastructure setup from infrastructure_setup stage
- [ ] Integrate staging service configurations with environment management system
- [ ] Update staging service environment variables via Render MCP
- [ ] Configure staging services to use centralized environment configuration
- [ ] Validate staging service functionality with new environment configuration

## Phase 3: Environment File Setup
- [ ] Create `.env.development` with development-specific values
- [ ] Create `.env.staging` with staging-specific values (using staging infrastructure endpoints)
- [ ] Create `.env.production` template (values to be set in deployment)
- [ ] Validate environment file completeness and consistency
- [ ] Document environment variable purposes and formats

## Phase 4: Shared Utilities Refactoring
- [ ] Refactor `shared/environment.ts` to use new configuration system
- [ ] Update database connection handling for environment awareness
- [ ] Implement environment-aware logging configuration
- [ ] Create environment detection utilities
- [ ] Update shared type definitions for environment configurations

## Phase 5: Frontend Module Refactoring
- [ ] Remove hardcoded API endpoints from frontend components
- [ ] Implement configuration service for frontend environment handling
- [ ] Update build process to inject environment configurations
- [ ] Refactor feature flags to use environment configuration
- [ ] Update frontend error handling for configuration issues

## Phase 6: Backend Service Refactoring
- [ ] Update API endpoint configurations to use environment variables
- [ ] Refactor authentication services for environment-specific settings
- [ ] Update third-party service integrations (payment, external APIs)

- [ ] Update middleware for environment-specific behavior

## Phase 7: Build System Integration
- [ ] Update package.json scripts for environment-specific builds
