# Environment Management Deployment Workflow

## Overview
Standardized deployment procedures ensuring safe, validated transitions between development, staging, and production environments.

## Deployment Principles
1. **No Direct Production Deployments**: All changes must flow through development → staging → production
2. **Automated Validation**: Every deployment stage includes automated validation
3. **Rollback Readiness**: Every deployment must have a tested rollback procedure
4. **Environment Parity**: Configurations tested in staging mirror production exactly
5. **Zero Downtime**: Production deployments minimize service interruption

## Environment Promotion Workflow

### Development Environment
**Purpose**: Initial development and testing of new features

**Deployment Triggers**:
- Feature branch merges to development branch
- Manual deployments for testing
- Automated deployments from CI/CD on development branch updates

**Validation Steps**:
1. Configuration schema validation
2. Unit test execution
3. Integration test execution
4. Local environment compatibility checks

**Rollback Procedure**: Git revert + automated redeployment

### Staging Environment
**Purpose**: Production-like testing and validation

**Deployment Triggers**:
- Manual promotion from validated development deployments
- Release candidate preparation
- Production deployment rehearsal

**Validation Steps**:
1. Full configuration validation against production schema
2. Complete test suite execution (unit, integration, E2E)
3. Performance baseline validation
4. Security scan and configuration audit
5. Manual acceptance testing
6. Load testing and stress testing

**Promotion Requirements**:
- [ ] All automated tests passing
- [ ] Manual QA sign-off
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Configuration validated against production requirements

**Rollback Procedure**: Automated rollback to previous stable staging deployment

### Production Environment
**Purpose**: Live application serving real users

**Deployment Triggers**:
- Manual promotion from validated staging deployments only
- Emergency hotfixes (with accelerated but complete validation)

**Validation Steps**:
1. Final configuration validation
2. Production deployment checklist verification
3. Blue-green or canary deployment strategy
4. Real-time monitoring during deployment
5. Post-deployment health checks
6. User acceptance validation

**Promotion Requirements**:
- [ ] Staging environment validation completed
- [ ] Production deployment checklist completed
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested in staging
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Team availability for deployment monitoring
- [ ] Communication plan executed (user notifications if needed)

**Rollback Procedure**: Immediate automated rollback with alert escalation

## Deployment Automation Scripts

### Development Deployment
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy-development.sh

set -e

echo "Starting development deployment..."

# Validate environment configuration
npm run validate:env-development

# Run tests
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration

# Build application
npm run build:development

# Deploy to development environment
npm run deploy:development

# Validate deployment
npm run verify:deployment-health

echo "Development deployment completed successfully"
```

### Staging Deployment
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy-staging.sh

set -e

echo "Starting staging deployment..."

# Validate environment configuration
npm run validate:env-staging

# Run full test suite
npm run test:all

# Performance validation
npm run test:performance

# Security scanning
npm run security:scan

# Build application
npm run build:staging

# Deploy to staging environment
npm run deploy:staging

# Comprehensive validation
npm run verify:staging-complete

echo "Staging deployment completed successfully"
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy-production.sh

set -e

echo "Starting production deployment..."

# Pre-deployment checks
npm run validate:env-production
npm run verify:staging-requirements

# Backup current production state
npm run backup:production

# Blue-green deployment
npm run deploy:production-blue-green

# Health monitoring
npm run monitor:deployment-health

# Traffic switching
npm run switch:production-traffic

# Post-deployment validation
npm run verify:production-health

echo "Production deployment completed successfully"
```

## Environment Configuration Management

### Configuration Validation
- **Schema Validation**: All environment variables match required schema
- **Dependency Checking**: All service dependencies are accessible
- **Credential Validation**: All API keys and credentials are valid
- **Feature Flag Verification**: Feature flags are properly configured

### Configuration Deployment
1. Configuration files are validated before deployment
2. Configuration changes are logged and auditable
3. Configuration rollback is available for quick recovery
4. Configuration encryption is maintained for sensitive values

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Deployment Monitoring
- Real-time deployment progress tracking
- Automated error detection and alerting
- Performance metric monitoring during deployments
- User impact monitoring and alerting

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
- Application health monitoring
- Configuration-specific metric tracking
- Error rate monitoring across environments
- Performance regression detection

## Emergency Procedures

### Hotfix Deployment
1. **Immediate Assessment**: Determine if staging validation can be accelerated
2. **Accelerated Testing**: Run critical test subset in staging
3. **Risk Assessment**: Document risks of bypassing full staging validation
4. **Approval Process**: Get explicit approval for emergency deployment
5. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Increased monitoring during and after deployment
6. **Post-Deployment Validation**: Full validation immediately after deployment

### Rollback Procedures
1. **Automated Rollback**: Triggered by health check failures
2. **Manual Rollback**: Available through deployment scripts
3. **Data Rollback**: Separate procedures for data-related rollbacks
4. **Communication**: Automated notifications for all rollback events

## Deployment Checklist Templates

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing in target environment
- [ ] Configuration validated and approved
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested and ready
- [ ] Team availability confirmed
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Communication plan ready (if needed)

### Post-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- [ ] Error rates normal
- [ ] User feedback monitored
- [ ] Deployment documented
- [ ] Team notified of successful deployment

## Success Metrics
- Zero failed deployments due to configuration issues
- Sub-10-minute deployment times for each environment
- 100% successful rollbacks when needed
- 99.9% deployment success rate
- Complete audit trail for all environment promotions
