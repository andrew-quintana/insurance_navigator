# FRACAS FM-038 Investigation Prompt

## Investigation Request

**Incident**: Chat Request Looping Issue  
**Date**: January 8, 2025  
**Investigator**: Claude (Sonnet) - Investigation Agent  
**Status**: Investigation Complete  

## Problem Statement

Users are experiencing chat requests that loop indefinitely without generating responses. The logs show successful RAG operations with 10 chunks returned, but users never receive a response and the request appears to hang indefinitely.

## Investigation Scope

### Primary Objectives
1. **Identify Root Cause**: Why are successful RAG operations not generating responses?
2. **Analyze Chat Flow**: How does the chat processing pipeline work after RAG operations?
3. **Evaluate Error Handling**: What error handling strategies are in place?
4. **Develop Resolution**: Create comprehensive fix for the hanging issue

### Key Areas of Investigation
- Chat processing pipeline after RAG operations
- Information Retrieval Agent response generation
- LLM call handling and error propagation
- Request timeout and fallback mechanisms

## Investigation Methodology

### Phase 1: Log Analysis
1. **Compare Logs**: Examine current logs vs working logs from commit 7970075
2. **Identify Patterns**: Look for differences in request processing
3. **Error Tracing**: Follow the request flow through the system
4. **Component Analysis**: Identify which components are failing

### Phase 2: Architecture Review
1. **Chat Flow Analysis**: Review complete chat processing pipeline
2. **Agent Integration**: Examine how agents are called and integrated
3. **Error Handling**: Evaluate error handling and timeout mechanisms
4. **Response Generation**: Analyze response generation process

### Phase 3: Root Cause Identification
1. **Component Isolation**: Identify the specific failing component
2. **Code Analysis**: Examine the failing code paths
3. **Error Propagation**: Understand how errors are handled
4. **Timeout Analysis**: Check for missing timeout mechanisms

### Phase 4: Resolution Development
1. **Fix Strategy**: Create targeted fix for the identified issue
2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and timeouts
3. **Testing**: Develop comprehensive testing approach
4. **Validation**: Ensure fix resolves the issue completely

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Clear explanation of why the issue occurs
2. **Technical Details**: Specific code locations and fixes needed
3. **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step fix strategy
4. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive validation approach
5. **Prevention Measures**: Guidelines to prevent similar issues

## Success Criteria

- Chat requests complete successfully and return responses
- RAG operations work properly when they succeed
- Proper error handling and timeouts are in place
- System architecture supports reliable request processing
- Backward compatibility is maintained

## Investigation Notes

### Key Findings
- RAG operations complete successfully (10 chunks, 401.4ms)
- Information Retrieval Agent response generation hangs
- LLM call in `_call_llm` method is not properly handled
- Missing timeout mechanisms and error handling
- Chat interface waits indefinitely for agent completion

### Resolution Strategy
- Fix async/await handling in Information Retrieval Agent
- Add timeout mechanisms for LLM calls
- Implement proper error handling and fallback responses
- Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting

### Prevention Measures
- Implement timeouts at all LLM interaction points
- Add comprehensive error handling for async operations
- Create integration tests for chat flow scenarios
- Establish monitoring for request timeouts

## Investigation Status

- [x] **Phase 1 Complete**: Log analysis and pattern identification
- [x] **Phase 2 Complete**: Architecture review and component analysis
- [x] **Phase 3 Complete**: Root cause identification
- [x] **Phase 4 Complete**: Resolution development and documentation

## Resolution Summary

The issue was identified as a hanging LLM call in the Information Retrieval Agent's `_call_llm` method. The RAG operations succeed, but the subsequent response generation process hangs indefinitely due to improper async handling and missing timeout mechanisms.

The resolution requires fixing the async/await handling, adding timeout mechanisms, and implementing proper error handling in the Information Retrieval Agent.
