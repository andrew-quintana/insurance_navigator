# FM-038 Systematic Investigation Prompt

## Problem Statement
Despite implementing multiple fixes (timeouts, logging, error handling), the chat system still exhibits the same failure pattern:
- RAG operations complete successfully (2 operations, 10 chunks each, ~413ms)
- RAG threshold analysis completes
- Logs stop completely - no chat processing logs appear
- No response returned to user

## Key Observation
Our comprehensive logging additions are NOT appearing in the logs, which means:
1. The code changes may not be deployed/active
2. The failure occurs BEFORE our logging takes effect
3. There's a different code path being executed

## Investigation Scope

### Phase 1: Verify Code Deployment
- [ ] Confirm our logging changes are actually active in the running system
- [ ] Check if the deployed code matches our branch
- [ ] Verify the specific commit hash running in production

### Phase 2: Trace the Actual Code Path
- [ ] Identify which specific code path is being executed
- [ ] Check if supervisor workflow is actually being called
- [ ] Verify if our timeout fixes are in the active codebase

### Phase 3: Identify the Real Failure Point
- [ ] Find where the logs stop after RAG operations
- [ ] Check if there's a different error handling path
- [ ] Look for silent exceptions or different routing logic

## Critical Questions

1. **Are our code changes actually running?**
   - The absence of our logging suggests they might not be
   - Need to verify deployment status

2. **What code path is actually being executed?**
   - The logs show RAG operations but no chat processing logs
   - This suggests a different execution path

3. **Where exactly do the logs stop?**
   - After RAG threshold analysis, before any chat processing
   - Need to identify the exact failure point

## Investigation Methodology

### Step 1: Code Verification
```bash
# Check current commit
git log --oneline -1

# Verify our changes are present
grep -r "Starting chat message processing" main.py
grep -r "Step 1: Converting workflow outputs" agents/patient_navigator/chat_interface.py
```

### Step 2: Add Minimal Logging
Add a single, simple log statement at the very beginning of the chat endpoint to verify our code is running:
```python
logger.info("=== CHAT ENDPOINT CALLED ===")
```

### Step 3: Trace Execution Flow
Add logging at every major decision point to see which path is taken:
- Chat endpoint entry
- Supervisor workflow decision
- Workflow routing
- Output processing

## Expected Outcomes

1. **If our logging appears**: The issue is in our code logic
2. **If our logging doesn't appear**: The issue is deployment/configuration
3. **If different logs appear**: There's a different code path being executed

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Identify exactly where the execution stops
- [ ] Confirm our code changes are active
- [ ] Determine the real root cause
- [ ] Implement a targeted fix

## Next Steps

1. Verify code deployment status
2. Add minimal logging to confirm code execution
3. Trace the actual execution path
4. Identify the real failure point
5. Implement targeted fix based on findings
