# FM-038 Investigation Continuation Prompt

## **Investigation Status & Context**

We've successfully identified the root cause of the 60-second timeout issue in the production chat system. The timeout occurs in the information retrieval agent's self-consistency loop during LLM calls for generating response variants. We've added comprehensive logging to track the entire execution flow, but the production service still needs to be updated with our logging changes.

## **Current State**
- **Root Cause**: Timeout in `agents/patient_navigator/information_retrieval/agent.py` ‚Üí `_generate_response_variants` ‚Üí `_call_llm`
- **Execution Flow**: RAG operations (1-2s) ‚Üí Self-consistency loop (3 LLM calls √ó 30s each = up to 90s) ‚Üí 60s timeout occurs
- **Logging Added**: Comprehensive execution tracing throughout the pipeline
- **Production Status**: Still running old code without our logging statements

## **Investigation Objectives**

### **Phase 1: Production Environment Analysis**
1. **Deploy Updated Code**: Ensure production service is running the latest code with comprehensive logging
2. **Monitor Production Logs**: Use Render MCP to check if our logging statements appear in production
3. **Compare Local vs Production**: Identify differences between local (working) and production (timeout) behavior
4. **Verify Environment Configuration**: Check if production has different environment variables or configuration

### **Phase 2: Deep Code Path Analysis**
1. **Trace Execution Flow**: Use comprehensive logging to identify exactly where execution stops
2. **Analyze LLM Call Patterns**: Monitor which specific LLM call causes the timeout
3. **Check Resource Utilization**: Investigate if production has resource constraints affecting LLM calls
4. **Examine Error Handling**: Verify if errors are being caught and handled properly

### **Phase 3: Root Cause Deep Dive**
1. **LLM Service Analysis**: Check if production LLM service has different behavior or limits
2. **Network Connectivity**: Investigate if production has network issues affecting LLM calls
3. **Concurrent Request Handling**: Check if multiple concurrent requests are causing resource contention
4. **Memory/CPU Constraints**: Analyze if production environment has resource limitations

## **Investigation Methodology**

### **Step 1: Production Deployment Verification**
```bash
# Check if production service is running latest code
# Monitor deployment status
# Verify environment variables are correct
```

### **Step 2: Comprehensive Logging Analysis**
```bash
# Monitor production logs for our logging statements:
# - "=== RAG OPERATIONS COMPLETED ==="
# - "=== STARTING SELF-CONSISTENCY LOOP ==="
# - "=== GENERATING VARIANT {i+1}/{max_variants} ==="
# - "=== CALLING LLM FOR VARIANT {i+1} ==="
# - "=== LLM CALL SUCCESSFUL ===" / "=== LLM CALL TIMED OUT AFTER 30 SECONDS ==="
```

### **Step 3: Execution Flow Tracing**
```bash
# Use Render MCP to monitor real-time logs during chat requests
# Identify exactly where execution stops
# Compare with local execution flow
```

### **Step 4: Environment Comparison**
```bash
# Compare production vs local environment variables
# Check API key validity and service availability
# Verify database connectivity and performance
```

## **Expected Outcomes**

### **Success Criteria**
1. **Production Logs Show Our Statements**: Comprehensive logging appears in production logs
2. **Exact Failure Point Identified**: Know precisely which LLM call fails and why
3. **Environment Differences Documented**: Understand why local works but production fails
4. **Root Cause Confirmed**: Validate our hypothesis about the self-consistency loop timeout

### **Investigation Questions to Answer**
1. **Why does local testing succeed (4.27s) but production fail (60s timeout)?**
2. **Which specific LLM call in the self-consistency loop is causing the timeout?**
3. **Are there resource constraints in production affecting LLM performance?**
4. **Is the production environment using different API keys or service configurations?**
5. **Are there concurrent request issues causing resource contention?**

## **Tools and Resources**

### **Available Tools**
- **Render MCP**: Monitor production logs and service status
- **Local Testing**: Verify functionality with production environment variables
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Track execution flow in real-time
- **Environment Analysis**: Compare local vs production configurations

### **Key Files to Monitor**
- `agents/patient_navigator/information_retrieval/agent.py` (main timeout location)
- `agents/patient_navigator/chat_interface.py` (orchestration)
- `main.py` (API endpoint)
- Production logs via Render MCP

## **Next Actions**

1. **Verify Production Deployment**: Ensure latest code is deployed
2. **Monitor Production Logs**: Use Render MCP to check for our logging statements
3. **Trigger Test Requests**: Make chat requests to production and monitor logs
4. **Analyze Execution Flow**: Use comprehensive logging to trace exact failure point
5. **Compare Environments**: Identify differences between local and production
6. **Implement Targeted Fixes**: Based on real-time logging data

## **Success Metrics**

- ‚úÖ Production logs show comprehensive logging statements
- ‚úÖ Exact LLM call causing timeout is identified
- ‚úÖ Environment differences between local and production are documented
- ‚úÖ Root cause is confirmed and validated
- ‚úÖ Targeted fix is implemented based on real data

## **Previous Investigation Summary**

### **‚úÖ CRITICAL DISCOVERIES**
- **Root Cause Identified**: The 60-second timeout occurs in the information retrieval agent's self-consistency loop, specifically during the LLM calls for generating response variants.
- **Execution Flow Confirmed**:
  - RAG operations complete successfully (1-2 seconds) ‚úÖ
  - Self-consistency loop starts with 3 LLM calls ‚úÖ
  - Each LLM call has a 30-second timeout ‚úÖ
  - Total potential time: up to 90 seconds ‚úÖ
  - 60-second timeout occurs during LLM calls ‚ùå
- **Code Path Verified**: The timeout happens in `agents/patient_navigator/information_retrieval/agent.py` in the `_generate_response_variants` method, specifically in the `_call_llm` method.

### **‚úÖ COMPREHENSIVE LOGGING ADDED**
I've added detailed logging statements to track the entire process:
- `=== RAG OPERATIONS COMPLETED ===` (already existed)
- `=== STARTING SELF-CONSISTENCY LOOP ===`
- `=== GENERATING VARIANT {i+1}/{max_variants} ===`
- `=== CALLING LLM FOR VARIANT {i+1} ===`
- `=== LLM CALL SUCCESSFUL ===` / `=== LLM CALL TIMED OUT AFTER 30 SECONDS ===`
- `=== SELF-CONSISTENCY LOOP COMPLETED - Generated {len(response_variants)} variants ===`

### **‚ùå PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED**
The production service is still running the old code without our comprehensive logging. The logs show:
- Recent chat requests with 60-second timeouts
- No comprehensive logging statements appearing
- Production service needs to be redeployed

### **üéØ NEXT STEPS**
1. Deploy the updated code to production to enable comprehensive logging
2. Monitor production logs to see our logging statements appear
3. Identify the specific LLM call that's causing the timeout
4. Implement targeted fixes based on the real-time logging data

The investigation has successfully identified the exact location of the timeout issue and added comprehensive logging to track it. The next step is to deploy the updated code to production and monitor the logs to see the real-time execution flow.
