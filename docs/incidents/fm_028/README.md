# FM-028: Intermittent Webhook Failures in Staging Environment

## üìã **Incident Overview**

**FRACAS ID**: FM-028  
**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Environment**: Staging (Render)  
**Service**: API Service - Webhook Handler  
**Severity**: P1 - High  
**Status**: Open - Investigation Required

---

## üö® **Failure Description**

### Primary Symptom
Intermittent webhook processing failures in the staging environment, causing document processing pipeline interruptions.

### Error Context
- **Location**: `api/upload_pipeline/webhooks.py` - LlamaParse webhook handler
- **Trigger**: External webhook callbacks from LlamaParse service
- **Result**: Document processing jobs fail to complete or get stuck
- **Impact**: Users experience incomplete document processing, leading to missing parsed content

### User Experience Impact
- Documents may appear to upload successfully but fail to process
- Parsed content may not be available for chat interactions
- Users may need to re-upload documents multiple times
- Processing status may show as "stuck" or "failed" intermittently

## üîç **Investigation Scope**

### Key Areas to Investigate
1. **Webhook Reliability**: Network connectivity and delivery issues
2. **Database Transactions**: Transaction failures during webhook processing
3. **Error Handling**: Incomplete error recovery mechanisms
4. **Resource Contention**: Memory/CPU issues during webhook processing
5. **External Service Dependencies**: LlamaParse service reliability
6. **Environment Configuration**: Staging-specific configuration issues

### Files to Investigate
- `api/upload_pipeline/webhooks.py` - Main webhook handler
- `backend/workers/enhanced_base_worker.py` - Webhook URL generation
- `backend/workers/base_worker.py` - Job processing logic
- `api/upload_pipeline/database.py` - Database operations
- `config/environment/` - Environment configuration

## üìù **Investigation Notes**

### Key Questions to Answer
1. What specific error patterns occur during webhook failures?
2. Are failures correlated with specific times, load levels, or document types?
3. Is the issue with webhook delivery, processing, or database updates?
4. Are there any patterns in the webhook payload or headers?
5. How does the staging environment differ from production in webhook handling?

### Tools Available
- Render MCP tools for log analysis
- Supabase MCP tools for database investigation
- Local development environment for replication
- Webhook testing tools and scripts
