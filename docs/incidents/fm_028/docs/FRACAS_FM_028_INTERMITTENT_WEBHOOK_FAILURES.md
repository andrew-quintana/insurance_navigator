# FRACAS FM-028: Intermittent Webhook Failures in Staging Environment

## Failure Mode Analysis and Corrective Action System (FRACAS)

**FRACAS ID**: FM-028  
**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Environment**: Staging (Render)  
**Service**: API Service - Webhook Handler  
**Severity**: P1 - High

---

## Executive Summary

Intermittent webhook processing failures in the staging environment are causing document processing pipeline interruptions. Users experience incomplete document processing, with documents appearing to upload successfully but failing to process completely. The issue appears to be staging-specific and may be related to recent deployments or configuration changes.

**Current Status**: 
- ‚úÖ Webhook handler code is functional
- ‚úÖ Database schema is correct
- ‚ùå Intermittent processing failures occurring
- ‚è≥ Root cause investigation required

---

## Failure Description

### Primary Symptom
```
Intermittent webhook processing failures causing document processing pipeline interruptions
```

### Error Context
- **Location**: `api/upload_pipeline/webhooks.py` - LlamaParse webhook handler
- **Trigger**: External webhook callbacks from LlamaParse service
- **Result**: Document processing jobs fail to complete or get stuck
- **Impact**: Users experience incomplete document processing, leading to missing parsed content

### User Experience Impact
- Documents may appear to upload successfully but fail to process
- Parsed content may not be available for chat interactions
- Users may need to re-upload documents multiple times
- Processing status may show as "stuck" or "failed" intermittently

## Root Cause Analysis Required

### 1. Log Analysis and Pattern Identification
**Task**: Analyze staging logs to identify failure patterns and root causes

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Retrieve recent webhook-related logs from staging environment
2. Identify failure patterns (timing, frequency, correlation)
3. Analyze webhook delivery and processing errors
4. Check for network connectivity issues

**Expected Output**: 
- Log analysis report with identified patterns
- Timeline of failures
- Error categorization

### 2. Database Transaction Analysis
**Task**: Investigate database transaction failures during webhook processing

**Files to Investigate**:
- `api/upload_pipeline/webhooks.py` (lines 40-310)
- `api/upload_pipeline/database.py`
- Database schema and constraints

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Check database connection issues and timeouts
2. Analyze job status update patterns
3. Review transaction logs for deadlocks or rollbacks
4. Check for connection pool exhaustion

**Expected Output**:
- Database transaction analysis report
- Identified database-related failure patterns
- Connection pool and transaction health assessment

### 3. Webhook Handler Code Review
**Task**: Review webhook handler code for error handling and reliability issues

**Files to Check**:
- `api/upload_pipeline/webhooks.py` - Main webhook handler
- `backend/workers/enhanced_base_worker.py` - Webhook URL generation
- `backend/workers/base_worker.py` - Job processing logic

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Analyze error handling completeness
2. Review database operations and transaction boundaries
3. Test webhook processing with various scenarios
4. Check for potential race conditions

**Expected Output**:
- Code review report with identified issues
- Test results for webhook processing
- Recommended code improvements

### 4. Environment Configuration Analysis
**Task**: Compare staging environment configuration with production

**Files to Check**:
- `config/environment/staging.yaml`
- `config/environment/production.yaml`
- Environment-specific configuration files

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Compare webhook configuration between environments
2. Check database connection settings and timeouts
3. Review resource allocation and limits
4. Test configuration changes

**Expected Output**:
- Configuration comparison report
- Identified configuration issues
- Recommended configuration changes

## Technical Context

### Webhook Handler Code
```python
@router.post("/webhook/llamaparse/{job_id}")
async def llamaparse_webhook(job_id: str, request: Request):
    """Handle LlamaParse webhook callbacks for document parsing completion."""
    try:
        # Enhanced logging for complete flow tracking
        logger.info(f"üîî FM-027 WEBHOOK START: Received webhook for job: {job_id}")
        
        # Get the raw body for signature verification
        body = await request.body()
        
        # Get webhook secret from database
        db = get_database()
        async with db.get_connection() as conn:
            # Process webhook payload and update job status
            # ... webhook processing logic ...
```

### Database Operations
```sql
-- Job status update during webhook processing
UPDATE upload_pipeline.upload_jobs
SET status = 'parsed', state = 'done', 
    updated_at = now()
WHERE job_id = $1
```

### Error Handling
```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(
        f"üîî EXCEPTION: Webhook processing failed for job {job_id}: {str(e)}",
        exc_info=True
    )
    raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Webhook processing failed")
```
