# Vercel Deployment Success - FM032 Resolution

**Date**: January 2025  
**Incident**: Vercel deployment failure for commit `920e3c1`  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Resolution**: Moved Vercel configuration to `ui/` directory for correct build context  

## Summary

The Vercel deployment failure has been successfully resolved by moving the Vercel configuration from the root directory to the `ui/` subdirectory. This fixed the build context mismatch that was causing module resolution errors.

## Resolution Details

### ‚úÖ **Successful Fix Applied**
- **Moved `vercel.json`** from root to `ui/` directory
- **Updated build commands** to remove `cd ui` (now building from `ui/` context)
- **Created `ui/.vercelignore`** with minimal exclusions
- **Removed root `vercel.json`** to avoid conflicts

### ‚úÖ **Deployment Status**
- **Preview Environment**: ‚úÖ Working correctly
- **Build Process**: ‚úÖ Successful compilation
- **Module Resolution**: ‚úÖ All `@/` imports resolve correctly
- **File Access**: ‚úÖ All UI components and libraries accessible

### ‚úÖ **Technical Validation**
- Local build test: `npm run build` in `ui/` directory ‚úÖ
- Module resolution: `@/components/ui/button`, `@/components/ui/card`, etc. ‚úÖ
- Supabase client: `@/lib/supabase-client.ts` ‚úÖ
- TypeScript path mapping: `@/*` resolves relative to `ui/` ‚úÖ

## Key Insight Confirmed

**CRITICAL**: When using `ui/vercel.json`, Vercel's root directory becomes the `ui/` subdirectory, not the project root. This ensures:
- Build context matches file structure
- TypeScript path mapping works correctly
- All UI files are accessible during build
- No `.vercelignore` conflicts

## Files Modified

- `vercel.json` ‚Üí `ui/vercel.json` (moved and updated)
- `ui/.vercelignore` (created)
- `.vercelignore` (removed from root)

## Commits

- `bba53d5`: Initial `.vercelignore` fixes
- `bbfcbdc`: Final fix - moved Vercel configuration to UI directory
- `512239b`: Added comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Deployment Working**: Preview environment successfully deployed
2. üîÑ **Production Testing**: Ready for production deployment
3. üìã **Documentation**: Complete incident report and deployment guide created
4. üîç **New Issue**: API connectivity 404 errors identified (separate incident)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Build Context is Critical**: Vercel's build context must match the application structure
2. **Configuration Drift**: Working commits can fail due to environment changes
3. **Investigation Approach**: Must investigate specific failing commits, not current state
4. **Incremental Fixes**: Partial fixes can reveal deeper architectural issues

---

**Resolution Confirmed**: Vercel deployment now works correctly with proper build context from `ui/` directory.
