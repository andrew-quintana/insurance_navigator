# FM-027 Investigation Summary

## Executive Summary

The FM-027 investigation has successfully identified the root causes of the "Document file is not accessible for processing. Please try uploading again." error in the Insurance Navigator document processing pipeline. The issue is caused by **timing-related race conditions** between job processing and file access in the Supabase Storage system.

## Key Findings

### 1. Root Causes Identified

- **Race Condition**: Jobs created with status "uploaded" before file upload completes
- **Job Status Timing**: Worker updates job status before file processing succeeds
- **Database Transaction Issues**: Jobs disappear from database while worker still processing
- **Stale Job Processing**: Worker processes jobs that no longer exist in database

### 2. Technical Architecture Analysis

The current architecture has several timing vulnerabilities:

```
Frontend → API Service → Database → Worker → Storage
    ↓         ↓           ↓         ↓        ↓
  Upload   Create Job   Update    Process  Access
   File    Status       Status    Job      File
```

**Timing Issues:**
- API service creates job with "uploaded" status immediately
- Worker processes job before file is fully accessible
- No verification that file exists before processing
- No retry mechanism for failed file access

### 3. Race Condition Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Immediate File Access
- Job created with status "uploaded"
- Worker immediately tries to access file
- File not yet accessible → Error

#### Scenario 2: Status Update Timing
- Job status updated to "uploaded"
- Worker processes job immediately
- File upload still in progress → Error

#### Scenario 3: Concurrent Processing
- Multiple jobs processed simultaneously
- Database transaction conflicts
- File access failures → Error

#### Scenario 4: Database Consistency
- Job exists in database
- File not yet in storage
- Processing fails → Error

## Solution Recommendations

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (High Priority)

#### 1.1 File Existence Check
**Location**: `backend/workers/enhanced_base_worker.py`
**Implementation**: Add file existence check before processing

```python
# Check if file exists before processing
file_exists = await self.storage.blob_exists(storage_path)
if not file_exists:
    # Wait and retry with exponential backoff
    for attempt in range(3):
        await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)
        file_exists = await self.storage.blob_exists(storage_path)
        if file_exists:
            break
    
    if not file_exists:
        raise UserFacingError("Document file is not accessible for processing")
```

#### 1.2 Job Status Update Delay
**Location**: `api/upload_pipeline/endpoints/upload.py`
**Implementation**: Add delay before updating job status

```python
# Wait for file to be accessible before updating job status
await asyncio.sleep(2.0)

# Verify file is accessible
file_accessible = await verify_file_accessibility(storage_path)
if not file_accessible:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="File not accessible")

# Update job status
await conn.execute("UPDATE upload_pipeline.upload_jobs SET status = 'uploaded' WHERE job_id = $1", job_id)
```

#### 1.3 Retry Mechanism
**Location**: `backend/workers/enhanced_base_worker.py`
**Implementation**: Add retry mechanism for file access

```python
# Retry mechanism for file access
max_retries = 3
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        file_content = await self.storage.read_blob(file_path)
        break
    except Exception as e:
        if attempt < max_retries - 1:
            await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
        else:
            raise UserFacingError("Document file is not accessible for processing")
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Monitoring (Medium Priority)

#### 2.1 Comprehensive Logging
- Add detailed timing logs for race condition detection
- Log file access attempts and failures
- Track job processing timing

#### 2.2 Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Implement circuit breaker for file access failures
- Stop processing if too many failures occur
- Automatic recovery after timeout

#### 2.3 Monitoring and Alerting
- Monitor file access success rate
- Alert on race condition detection
- Track job processing performance

### Phase 3: Advanced Solutions (Low Priority)

#### 3.1 Job Queuing with Backoff
- Implement job queuing with backoff strategies
- Process jobs with appropriate delays
- Handle concurrent processing better

#### 3.2 Database Transaction Locking
- Add proper database transaction locking
- Prevent race conditions in database operations
- Ensure job consistency
