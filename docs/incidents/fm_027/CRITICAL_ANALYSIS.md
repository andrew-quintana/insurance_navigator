# FM-027 Critical Analysis: Persistent 400 Bad Request Issue

## Executive Summary

**Status**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Worker still getting 400 Bad Request despite endpoint fix
**Issue**: Worker gets 400 Bad Request while direct tests return 200 OK
**Root Cause**: Unknown - likely environment variable or authentication issue

## Key Findings

### 1. Endpoint Fix Applied ‚úÖ
- Fixed StorageManager to use correct `/storage/v1/object/` endpoints
- All methods now use proper Supabase storage API format
- Direct testing confirms endpoints work correctly

### 2. File Exists ‚úÖ
- File `user/74a635ac-4bfe-4b6e-87d2-c0f54a366fbe/raw/fd5b5f12_5e4390c2.pdf` exists in storage
- Direct HEAD request returns 200 OK
- StorageManager test returns `True` for file existence

### 3. Worker Still Failing ‚ùå
- Worker logs show 400 Bad Request for same file
- Worker uses identical URL and headers as successful test
- Error occurs consistently across multiple retry attempts

## The Mystery

**Why does the worker get 400 Bad Request when:**
1. ‚úÖ The file exists in storage
2. ‚úÖ The endpoint is correct (`/storage/v1/object/files/...`)
3. ‚úÖ The authentication headers are correct
4. ‚úÖ Direct testing with same configuration works

## Potential Root Causes

### 1. Environment Variable Mismatch
- Worker might be loading different environment variables
- Service role key might be different in worker context
- Base URL might be different in worker context

### 2. Authentication Context Issue
- Worker might be using different authentication context
- Service role key might be expired or invalid in worker
- Headers might be different in worker environment

### 3. Timing/Race Condition
- Worker might be hitting rate limits
- Storage might be rejecting requests from worker IP
- Authentication might be timing out

### 4. Environment Mismatch
- Worker might be connected to different Supabase project
- Worker might be using production vs staging environment
- Database vs storage environment mismatch

## Investigation Needed

### 1. Worker Environment Variables
- Check what environment variables worker actually loads
- Compare worker config with expected staging config
- Verify service role key is correct in worker

### 2. Worker Authentication
- Test worker's actual authentication headers
- Verify service role key is valid in worker context
- Check if worker is using different authentication method

### 3. Environment Context
- Verify worker is using staging environment
- Check if worker is connected to correct Supabase project
- Ensure database and storage are from same environment

## Next Steps

1. **Add detailed logging** to worker to show actual environment variables
2. **Test worker authentication** directly from worker environment
3. **Compare worker config** with expected staging configuration
4. **Check for environment mismatches** between database and storage

## Related Incidents

- **FM-012**: Storage access failure (RLS policies) - ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **FM-025**: Processing pipeline failure (same error) - üî¥ PERSISTENT
- **FM-009**: Environment variable priority mismatch - üîç POTENTIAL ROOT CAUSE
- **FM-017**: JWT secret mismatch - üîç POTENTIAL ROOT CAUSE

## Status

üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Worker still failing despite endpoint fix
üéØ **FOCUS** - Environment variable or authentication issue
‚è∞ **URGENT** - Need to identify why worker gets 400 when direct test gets 200
