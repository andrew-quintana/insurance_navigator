# FM-037 RAG Communication Failure

## Incident Overview

**FRACAS ID**: FM-037  
**Date**: January 8, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED**  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Environment**: Production Chat Interface  

## Problem Summary

RAG operations were succeeding (as evidenced by logs showing successful retrieval of 10 chunks), but users were receiving fallback messages stating "I apologize, but I'm currently unable to access your documents..." This created a confusing user experience where the system was actually working but appeared to be failing.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by graceful degradation being applied too broadly to the entire chat processing pipeline instead of just RAG operations. When any component in the chat processing pipeline failed (such as the two-stage synthesizer or communication agent), it would trigger the RAG degradation fallback, even though the RAG operations themselves were successful.

## Resolution

### Fix 1: Dict Content Error (PR #8)
- Fixed `StaticFallback` to return proper `ChatResponse` objects instead of dictionaries
- Added backward compatibility for both response types

### Fix 2: Graceful Degradation Scope (PR #9)
- Removed graceful degradation from chat interface level
- Added proper error handling for different failure types
- Ensured graceful degradation only applies to actual RAG operations

## Files Modified

- `core/resilience/graceful_degradation.py` - Fixed fallback response type
- `main.py` - Removed graceful degradation from chat interface level

## Impact

- **Before**: Users received confusing fallback messages despite successful RAG operations
- **After**: Users receive appropriate responses when RAG succeeds, and proper error messages for actual failures

## Lessons Learned

1. **Graceful Degradation Scope**: Must be carefully scoped to specific services, not entire pipelines
2. **Error Visibility**: Real errors must be visible for proper debugging
3. **User Experience**: Technical success doesn't guarantee good user experience
4. **System Architecture**: Pipeline-level degradation can mask component-level issues

## Prevention Measures

1. **Service-Specific Degradation**: Apply degradation at the service level, not pipeline level
2. **Error Categorization**: Different error types require different handling strategies
3. **Response Consistency**: Maintain consistent response types throughout the system
4. **User-Centric Design**: Consider user experience in technical implementations
