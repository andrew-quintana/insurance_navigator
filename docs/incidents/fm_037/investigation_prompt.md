# FM-037 Investigation Prompt

## Investigation Context

**Incident**: RAG Communication Failure  
**Date**: January 8, 2025  
**Status**: Investigation Complete  
**Priority**: HIGH  

## Investigation Objectives

1. **Identify Root Cause**: Determine why RAG operations succeed but users receive fallback messages
2. **Analyze System Architecture**: Understand how graceful degradation is applied
3. **Evaluate Error Handling**: Assess current error handling strategies
4. **Develop Resolution**: Create comprehensive fix for the issue

## Key Questions to Answer

### Technical Analysis
- Why are RAG operations succeeding but users receiving fallback messages?
- How is graceful degradation currently implemented in the chat interface?
- What components in the chat processing pipeline could be failing?
- How should graceful degradation be properly scoped?

### User Experience
- What is the actual user experience when RAG operations succeed?
- How do fallback messages impact user trust and satisfaction?
- What error messages are appropriate for different failure types?

### System Architecture
- Should graceful degradation apply to entire pipelines or specific services?
- How can we ensure real errors are visible for debugging?
- What is the proper separation of concerns for error handling?

## Investigation Methodology

### Phase 1: Error Analysis
1. Analyze error logs and identify specific error messages
2. Trace error flow through the system
3. Identify where graceful degradation is triggered
4. Determine why fallback messages are inappropriate

### Phase 2: Architecture Review
1. Review graceful degradation implementation
2. Analyze chat processing pipeline components
3. Identify where degradation should be applied
4. Evaluate current error handling strategies

### Phase 3: Resolution Development
1. Design proper error handling approach
2. Implement targeted graceful degradation
3. Ensure backward compatibility
4. Validate fix through testing

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Root Cause Identified**: Clear understanding of why the issue occurs
2. **Architecture Improved**: Better separation of concerns for error handling
3. **User Experience Enhanced**: Users receive appropriate responses
4. **System Reliability Improved**: Better error visibility and handling

## Success Criteria

- RAG operations work properly when they succeed
- Users receive appropriate error messages for actual failures
- Real errors are visible for debugging
- System architecture supports proper error handling
- Backward compatibility is maintained

## Investigation Notes

### Key Findings
- Graceful degradation was applied to entire chat processing pipeline
- RAG operations were succeeding but other components were failing
- Fallback messages were inappropriate for successful RAG operations
- Error masking prevented proper debugging

### Resolution Strategy
- Remove graceful degradation from chat interface level
- Apply degradation only to specific RAG operations
- Implement proper error handling for different failure types
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing responses

### Prevention Measures
- Establish guidelines for graceful degradation scope
- Implement proper error categorization
- Add monitoring for different error types
- Update code review processes
