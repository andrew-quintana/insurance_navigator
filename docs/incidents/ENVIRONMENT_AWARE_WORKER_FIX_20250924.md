# Environment-Aware Worker Configuration Fix
**Date:** 2025-09-24  
**Fix ID:** ENV-WORKER-FIX-20250924  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Problem Statement

The worker system was hardcoded to load `.env.development` regardless of the actual environment, making it inflexible for different deployment environments (development, staging, production).

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Hardcoded Environment Loading**: Both `enhanced_runner.py` and `worker_config.py` were hardcoded to load `.env.development`
2. **No Environment Validation**: No validation that the required environment file exists
3. **Silent Fallbacks**: System would silently fall back to system environment variables instead of failing gracefully
4. **Inconsistent Environment Detection**: Environment detection logic was inconsistent across components

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Environment-Aware Worker Runner** ✅
- **File**: `backend/workers/enhanced_runner.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Requires `ENVIRONMENT` variable to be set explicitly
  - Loads environment-specific `.env.{environment}` file
  - Fails gracefully with clear error messages if environment file not found
  - No silent fallbacks to system environment variables

### 2. **Cleaned Up Worker Configuration** ✅
- **File**: `backend/shared/config/worker_config.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed hardcoded `.env.development` loading
  - Now relies on calling process to load environment variables
  - Maintains support for both `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` naming conventions

### 3. **Updated Development Scripts** ✅
- **File**: `scripts/start-dev.sh`
- **Changes**:
  - Explicitly sets `ENVIRONMENT=development`
  - Loads environment variables from `.env.development`

### 4. **Created Environment-Specific Scripts** ✅
- **Files**: `scripts/start-staging.sh`, `scripts/start-production.sh`
- **Features**:
  - Set appropriate `ENVIRONMENT` variable
  - Load corresponding `.env.{environment}` file
  - Environment-specific configuration

## Testing Results

### ✅ **Environment Variable Required**
```bash
# Without ENVIRONMENT set - FAILS as expected
$ python backend/workers/enhanced_runner.py
ERROR: ENVIRONMENT variable not set. Please set ENVIRONMENT to 'development', 'staging', or 'production'
```

### ✅ **Valid Environment Works**
```bash
# With ENVIRONMENT=development - WORKS
$ export ENVIRONMENT=development && python backend/workers/enhanced_runner.py
INFO: Loaded environment variables from .env.development
INFO: Enhanced worker configuration loaded and validated
```

### ✅ **Invalid Environment Fails Gracefully**
```bash
# With invalid environment - FAILS with clear error
$ export ENVIRONMENT=invalid && python backend/workers/enhanced_runner.py
ERROR: Environment file .env.invalid not found. Please ensure the environment file exists for environment 'invalid'.
```

## Benefits

1. **Environment Isolation**: Each environment uses its own configuration file
2. **Fail-Fast Behavior**: Clear error messages when environment configuration is missing
3. **Flexible Deployment**: Easy to switch between environments
4. **Consistent Naming**: Supports both `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
5. **No Silent Failures**: System fails explicitly rather than falling back silently

## Usage

### Development
```bash
./scripts/start-dev.sh
# Sets ENVIRONMENT=development and loads .env.development
```

### Staging
```bash
./scripts/start-staging.sh
# Sets ENVIRONMENT=staging and loads .env.staging
```

### Production
```bash
./scripts/start-production.sh
# Sets ENVIRONMENT=production and loads .env.production
```

### Manual Worker Start
```bash
export ENVIRONMENT=development
python backend/workers/enhanced_runner.py
```

## Files Modified

- `backend/workers/enhanced_runner.py` - Environment-aware loading
- `backend/shared/config/worker_config.py` - Removed hardcoded loading
- `scripts/start-dev.sh` - Added ENVIRONMENT variable
- `scripts/start-staging.sh` - New staging script
- `scripts/start-production.sh` - New production script

## Next Steps

1. Create `.env.staging` and `.env.production` files with appropriate values
2. Test staging and production deployments
3. Update deployment documentation to include environment variable requirements
4. Consider adding environment validation to CI/CD pipelines
