# FM-032: Proper Investigation Prompt - Why Did a Working Commit Stop Working?

## The Real Question
**Why did commit `920e3c1` ("Add disclaimer and update HIPAA references") that deployed successfully before now fail with module resolution errors?**

## Investigation Approach

### Phase 1: Establish Baseline
**Objective**: Confirm the exact state that's failing

1. **Verify Current State**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -1  # Should show: 920e3c1 Add disclaimer and update HIPAA references
   git status            # Should show: working tree clean
   ```

2. **Test Local Build**
   ```bash
   cd ui && npm run build
   ```
   - If this works locally but fails on Vercel, the issue is environment-specific
   - If this fails locally, the issue is in the codebase itself

3. **Check What Changed Since Last Success**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --since="2 weeks ago"
   git show 920e3c1 --name-only
   ```

### Phase 2: External Factor Analysis
**Objective**: Determine if external factors caused the failure

1. **Vercel Platform Changes**
   - Check Vercel's changelog for recent updates
   - Verify if Node.js version changed on Vercel
   - Check if build environment specifications changed

2. **Dependency Registry Issues**
   - Check if npm registry has issues
   - Verify if specific packages are temporarily unavailable
   - Check for any security-related package restrictions

3. **Environment Configuration Drift**
   - Compare current environment variables with working deployment
   - Check if any secrets or API keys expired
   - Verify if external services changed

### Phase 3: Dependency Analysis
**Objective**: Check if dependencies changed externally

1. **Package Lock Analysis**
   ```bash
   cd ui && npm ls tailwindcss
   npm ls @supabase/supabase-js
   ```

2. **Check for Breaking Changes**
   - Review changelogs of major dependencies
   - Check if any packages were deprecated
   - Verify if peer dependency requirements changed

3. **Node.js Version Compatibility**
   - Check if Vercel updated Node.js version
   - Verify if current dependencies support the new version

### Phase 4: Build Context Analysis
**Objective**: Understand the build environment differences

1. **Vercel Build Logs Analysis**
   - Compare current build logs with successful deployment
   - Look for differences in dependency installation
   - Check for warnings or errors in the build process

2. **File Inclusion Verification**
   ```bash
   # Check what files are actually included in deployment
   cat .vercelignore
   # Verify critical files are not excluded
   ```

3. **Build Command Analysis**
   - Verify install and build commands are correct
   - Check if working directory is set properly
   - Ensure environment variables are available

### Phase 5: Comparative Analysis
**Objective**: Compare with last successful deployment

1. **Deployment History Review**
   - Find the last successful deployment of this commit
   - Compare build logs between success and failure
   - Identify what changed in the environment

2. **External Service Status**
   - Check if Supabase is having issues
   - Verify if API endpoints are accessible
   - Check if any external dependencies are down

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **When did this commit last work successfully?**
2. **What changed in the environment since then?**
3. **Are there any external factors (Vercel, npm, Node.js) that changed?**
4. **Is this a temporary issue or a permanent breaking change?**
5. **What's the root cause of the module resolution failure?**

## Hypothesis Testing

### Hypothesis 1: Vercel Platform Update
**Test**: Check Vercel changelog for recent updates
**Expected**: Platform changes that affect build process
**Action**: Adapt to new platform requirements

### Hypothesis 2: Dependency Version Conflicts
**Test**: Compare package-lock.json with working version
**Expected**: Dependencies updated to incompatible versions
**Action**: Lock dependency versions or update code

### Hypothesis 3: External Service Issues
**Test**: Check if Supabase or other services are down
**Expected**: External dependencies unavailable
**Action**: Wait for service restoration or implement fallbacks

### Hypothesis 4: Environment Configuration Drift
**Test**: Compare environment variables
**Expected**: Missing or changed environment variables
**Action**: Restore correct environment configuration

### Hypothesis 5: Build Cache Corruption
**Test**: Clear Vercel build cache
**Expected**: Cached dependencies are corrupted
**Action**: Force fresh build

## Success Criteria

1. **Root Cause Identified**: Understand exactly why the working commit now fails
2. **External vs Internal**: Determine if issue is external (platform/service) or internal (code)
3. **Solution Strategy**: Develop appropriate fix based on root cause
4. **Prevention Plan**: Create measures to prevent similar issues

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the exact failing commit** to reproduce the error
2. **Compare with last successful deployment** of the same commit
3. **Identify the specific change** that caused the failure
4. **Implement targeted fix** based on root cause
5. **Document lessons learned** for future deployments

---

**Key Insight**: The goal is not to fix the code, but to understand WHY a previously working commit stopped working. This is a classic "it worked before" debugging scenario that requires systematic analysis of external factors.
