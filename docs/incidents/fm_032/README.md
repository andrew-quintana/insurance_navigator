# FM-032: Vercel Deployment Failure Investigation

## Overview
This directory contains all documentation related to FM-032, which investigated Vercel deployment failures due to build context mismatch and module resolution errors.

## Status
‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Vercel deployment now working correctly

## Key Resolution
- **Root Cause**: Build context mismatch - Vercel was building from root but running commands in `ui/` subdirectory
- **Solution**: Moved `vercel.json` from root to `ui/` directory for correct build context
- **Result**: All module resolution errors fixed, deployment successful

## Files in this Directory

### Incident Reports
- `vercel-deployment-failure-fm032.md` - Initial incident report documenting the deployment failure
- `vercel-deployment-success-fm032.md` - Success report documenting the resolution

### Investigation Documents
- `fm_032_deployment_failure_investigation.md` - Detailed investigation documentation
- `fm_032_final_investigation_summary.md` - Final investigation summary

## Related Documentation
- **Main Investigation**: `/docs/fm_032/` - Complete failure mode investigation framework
- **Deployment Guide**: `/docs/deployment/vercel-build-context-guide.md` - Guide for Vercel build context

## Key Learnings
1. **Build Context Matters**: Vercel's build context must match the file structure
2. **Configuration Drift**: Working commits can fail due to environment changes
3. **Path Resolution**: TypeScript path mapping depends on build context
4. **Investigation Approach**: Always investigate the specific failing commit, not current state

## Commits
- `bbfcbdc`: Fix: Move Vercel configuration to ui/ directory for correct build context
- `512239b`: Add comprehensive documentation for Vercel deployment failure investigation
- `19f319a`: Correct incident report - 400 Bad Request authentication errors

## Next Steps
- ‚úÖ Vercel deployment working
- üîç FM-033: Supabase authentication 400 errors (separate investigation)
