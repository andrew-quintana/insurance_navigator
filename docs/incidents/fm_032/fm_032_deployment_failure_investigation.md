# FM-032: Deployment Failure Investigation - Previously Working Commit Now Failing

## Incident Summary
**Date**: Current  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: Investigating  
**Reference**: FM-032  

A previously working commit (920e3c1) that deployed successfully before is now failing on Vercel with build errors. This suggests either:
1. External dependency changes
2. Vercel platform changes
3. Environment configuration issues
4. Hidden dependency conflicts

## Error Analysis

### Primary Error
```
Error: Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'
Require stack:
- /vercel/path0/ui/node_modules/next/dist/build/webpack/config/blocks/css/plugins.js
```

### Secondary Errors
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/ui/button'
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/ui/card'
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/DocumentUploadModal'
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/auth/SessionManager'
```

## Investigation Prompt

### Phase 1: Dependency Analysis
**Objective**: Determine if external dependencies have changed since last successful deployment

1. **Package Version Comparison**
   - Compare current `package.json` with the version that worked
   - Check if any dependencies were updated between deployments
   - Verify if `tailwindcss` is properly listed in `devDependencies`

2. **Node.js Version Analysis**
   - Check if Vercel's Node.js version changed
   - Current requirement: `"node": ">=18.0.0"`
   - Verify if this affects dependency resolution

3. **NPM Install Behavior**
   - Analyze the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag usage
   - Check if peer dependency conflicts emerged
   - Verify if npm version changes affect installation

### Phase 2: Build Configuration Analysis
**Objective**: Identify configuration issues that might cause module resolution failures

1. **Vercel Configuration**
   - Verify `vercel.json` build commands are correct
   - Check if `installCommand` and `buildCommand` are properly configured
   - Ensure working directory is set correctly (`cd ui`)

2. **Next.js Configuration**
   - Check `next.config.ts` for any changes
   - Verify PostCSS configuration
   - Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured

3. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Verify `tsconfig.json` path mappings
   - Check if `@/` alias is properly configured
   - Ensure module resolution is working

### Phase 3: File Structure Analysis
**Objective**: Confirm all required files are present and accessible

1. **Component File Verification**
   - Verify `ui/components/ui/button.tsx` exists
   - Verify `ui/components/ui/card.tsx` exists
   - Verify `ui/components/DocumentUploadModal.tsx` exists
   - Verify `ui/components/auth/SessionManager.tsx` exists

2. **Vercel Ignore Analysis**
   - Check `.vercelignore` doesn't exclude necessary files
   - Verify UI components are not being filtered out
   - Ensure `tailwind.config.js` is not ignored

3. **Build Context Verification**
   - Confirm Vercel is building from correct directory
   - Verify file paths are relative to build context
   - Check if symlinks or file permissions are issues

### Phase 4: Environment and Platform Analysis
**Objective**: Identify external factors that might cause the failure

1. **Vercel Platform Changes**
   - Check Vercel's changelog for recent updates
   - Verify if build environment specifications changed
   - Check if Node.js version was updated on Vercel

2. **Dependency Registry Issues**
   - Check if npm registry has issues
   - Verify if specific packages are temporarily unavailable
   - Check for any security-related package restrictions

3. **Build Cache Analysis**
   - Verify if build cache corruption occurred
   - Check if previous successful builds used different cache
   - Analyze if cache invalidation is needed

### Phase 5: Comparative Analysis
**Objective**: Compare current state with last successful deployment

1. **Git Diff Analysis**
   - Compare current commit with last working deployment
   - Check for any uncommitted changes
   - Verify if `.vercelignore` was modified

2. **Deployment History**
   - Review Vercel deployment logs for successful builds
   - Compare build commands and environment variables
   - Check if any environment variables changed

3. **Dependency Lock Analysis**
   - Compare `package-lock.json` with working version
   - Check if dependency tree changed
   - Verify if transitive dependencies were updated

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Verify Current State
```bash
# Check current commit
git log --oneline -1

# Verify package.json dependencies
cat ui/package.json | grep -A 20 "devDependencies"

# Check if tailwindcss is installed
ls ui/node_modules/tailwindcss

# Verify component files exist
ls -la ui/components/ui/
ls -la ui/components/auth/
```

### 2. Test Local Build
```bash
# Navigate to UI directory
cd ui

# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Test build
npm run build
```

### 3. Check Vercel Configuration
```bash
# Verify vercel.json
cat vercel.json

# Check .vercelignore
cat .vercelignore
```

## Hypothesis Testing

### Hypothesis 1: Tailwind CSS Missing
**Test**: Check if `tailwindcss` is properly installed
**Expected**: Should be in `devDependencies`
**Action**: Reinstall if missing

### Hypothesis 2: Module Resolution Issues
**Test**: Verify TypeScript path mappings
**Expected**: `@/` should resolve to correct directory
**Action**: Fix tsconfig.json if needed

### Hypothesis 3: Vercel Build Context
**Test**: Verify build commands use correct working directory
**Expected**: Commands should run from `ui/` directory
**Action**: Fix vercel.json if needed

### Hypothesis 4: Dependency Version Conflicts
**Test**: Compare with working package-lock.json
**Expected**: Dependencies should match working version
**Action**: Restore working package-lock.json

## Success Criteria

1. **Build Success**: `npm run build` completes without errors
2. **Module Resolution**: All `@/` imports resolve correctly
3. **Tailwind CSS**: PostCSS can find and load Tailwind CSS
4. **Component Loading**: All UI components load without module errors
5. **Vercel Deployment**: Deployment completes successfully

## Root Cause Analysis

**IDENTIFIED**: The issue was caused by **uncommitted changes** to the `.vercelignore` file.

### Root Cause Details
1. **Commit 920e3c1** (the "working" commit) was missing the line `!ui/lib/supabase-client.ts` in `.vercelignore`
2. **Working Directory** had this line added but not committed
3. **Vercel Deployment** uses the committed version of files, not working directory changes
4. **Result**: `ui/lib/supabase-client.ts` was excluded from deployment, causing module resolution failures

### Error Chain
```
.vercelignore missing !ui/lib/supabase-client.ts
→ Vercel excludes supabase-client.ts from deployment
→ Next.js build tries to import @/lib/supabase-client
→ Module not found error
→ Build fails
```

## Solution Implemented

**Fix**: Added `!ui/lib/supabase-client.ts` to `.vercelignore` and committed the change.

```bash
# The fix was:
git add .vercelignore
git commit -m "Fix: Include supabase-client.ts in Vercel deployment"
```

**Commit**: `7dafab3` - Fix: Include supabase-client.ts in Vercel deployment

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ **Local Build**: Confirmed working (`npm run build` succeeds)
2. ✅ **Dependencies**: All packages properly installed
3. ✅ **Component Files**: All referenced components exist
4. ✅ **Configuration**: TypeScript and Next.js configs are correct
5. ✅ **Root Cause**: Identified uncommitted `.vercelignore` changes
6. ✅ **Fix Applied**: Committed the missing `.vercelignore` line

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Push the fix to trigger new Vercel deployment
2. **Verify**: Confirm deployment succeeds
3. **Monitor**: Watch for similar issues in future deployments

## Prevention Measures

1. **Pre-deployment Checklist**: Always check for uncommitted changes
2. **CI/CD Validation**: Add step to verify all required files are included
3. **Documentation**: Update deployment procedures to include `.vercelignore` validation

## Documentation Requirements

- ✅ Document root cause analysis
- ✅ Update deployment procedures if needed
- ⏳ Add monitoring for similar issues
- ⏳ Create runbook for dependency-related failures
