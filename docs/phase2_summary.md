# Phase 2 Implementation Summary: Agent Modules

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the agent modules as specified in Phase 2 of the vibe_coding_directive.md. We have successfully created a modular, testable foundation for the insurance navigator multi-agent system.

## Implemented Agents

### Base Agent
- Provides common functionality for all agents
- Implements logging, error handling, and performance tracking
- Serves as the foundation for other agent implementations
- Follows the principle of composition over inheritance

### Prompt Security Agent
- Detects prompt injection attempts and unsafe content
- Sanitizes user inputs while preserving intent
- Implements pattern matching with regex
- Uses an LLM-based security check with a structured output format
- Has comprehensive test coverage

### Policy Compliance Agent
- Evaluates insurance policy compliance
- Checks if a service is covered under a policy
- Identifies relevant policy rules and exceptions
- Provides detailed compliance assessments with confidence scores
- Handles various policy types and service categories

### Document Parser Agent
- Extracts structured information from insurance documents
- Implements a document parsing pipeline
- Handles different document types (policies, EOBs, etc.)
- Extracts entities like policy numbers, coverage details, and dates
- Provides confidence scores for extracted information

### Healthcare Guide Agent
- Develops personalized healthcare navigation guides
- Integrates information from various sources
- Creates step-by-step action plans
- Implements guide generation with templates
- Provides personalized recommendations

### Service Provider Agent
- Identifies local, matching service providers for healthcare services
- Integrates with provider databases
- Filters providers based on specialty, location, and network status
- Provides detailed provider information
- Implements distance calculation and network status verification

### Service Access Strategy Agent
- Identifies matching healthcare services based on patient needs
- Builds action plans for accessing services efficiently
- Coordinates with Policy Compliance and Service Provider agents
- Creates comprehensive service access strategies
- Handles complex medical needs with personalized guidance

### Guide to PDF Agent
- Creates PDF guides for users based on healthcare navigation guidance
- Converts structured guide information into formatted documents
- Ensures guides are visually appealing and easy to understand
- Generates consistent and professional documentation
- Implements automatic performance evaluation for continuous improvement

### Patient Navigator Agent
- Serves as the front-facing chatbot for users
- Understands user needs and questions
- Provides clear and accessible information about Medicare
- Coordinates with other specialized agents
- Maintains conversation context across multiple interactions
- Ensures security through prompt sanitization

### Intent Structuring Agent
- Identifies and categorizes user intents from natural language queries
- Converts unstructured requests into structured, actionable intents
- Identifies key parameters and constraints in user requests
- Maps intents to appropriate system capabilities
- Supports consistent intent resolution across the system

### Database Guard Agent
- Converts data to structured formats for database storage
- Checks for and redacts sensitive information
- Securely stores data to the database with retry logic
- Logs successful operations and returns identifiers
- Detects malformed or malicious content
- Implements JSON structure validation and HIPAA compliance checks

### Task Requirements Agent
- Interprets user task intents
- Queries policy and regulatory requirements
- Generates input checklists for tasks
- Defines expected outputs for tasks
- Formats requirements into structured objects
- Ensures freshness of policy references

### Quality Assurance Agent
- Validates output structure and format
- Checks logical and factual consistency
- Flags low-confidence content
- Escalates failed validations
- Logs QA decisions for traceability
- Implements confidence threshold tuning

### Regulatory Agent
- Detects and redacts sensitive information (PHI/PII)
- Ensures compliance with HIPAA regulations
- Verifies adherence to CMS guidelines
- Adds appropriate disclaimers and advisory language
- Tracks provenance of recommendations for auditability
- Implements nested content security scanning

## Testing and Documentation

All agents have:
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Clear documentation
- Error handling
- Logging
- Performance tracking

## API Key Management

The system uses a `.env` file for all API keys and sensitive configuration:
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for the Claude model
- LANGCHAIN_API_KEY for LangSmith tracing
- Optional keys for other service providers

The `.env` file is properly included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure of secrets.

## Next Steps

Now that we have implemented all the required agents, we can move on to Phase 3, which will focus on integrating the agents into the complete system and developing the user interface components.

## Conclusion

Phase 2 has been successfully completed with the implementation of all the specified agent modules. The foundation is now in place for the full Medicare Navigator system.
