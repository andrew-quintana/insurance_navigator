# FM-027 Solution: Storage Authentication Context Mismatch

## Root Cause Identified ‚úÖ

**Issue**: The new Supabase authentication mechanism introduced in the auth migration is causing existing files to become inaccessible.

**Specific Problem**: 
- Files created before the auth migration (2025-09-26) were created with a different service role key
- Files exist in the `storage.objects` database table but are not accessible via the storage API
- New files created with the current service role key work correctly

## Technical Details

### Authentication Context Mismatch
- **Old files**: Created with previous service role key/authentication context
- **New files**: Created with current JWT-based service role key
- **Storage API**: Works correctly but only for files created with current auth context

### Evidence
1. ‚úÖ Storage API is working (can create/access new files)
2. ‚úÖ Service role key is valid JWT token
3. ‚úÖ Storage policies are correctly configured
4. ‚ùå Existing files return "Object not found" (404) via storage API
5. ‚úÖ New files created with current auth are accessible

## Solution

### Immediate Fix
1. **Re-upload existing files** through the normal upload process
2. **Files will be recreated** with the current authentication context
3. **Processing will resume** normally for re-uploaded files

### Long-term Prevention
1. **Monitor authentication context changes** in future migrations
2. **Implement file migration scripts** for auth context changes
3. **Add validation** to ensure files are accessible after creation

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Root cause analysis
- [x] Authentication context verification
- [x] Storage API functionality testing
- [x] Solution identification

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] Test with staging environment
- [ ] Document for team

### üìã Next Steps
1. **Re-upload the problematic file** through the UI
2. **Verify processing resumes** normally
3. **Monitor for any other affected files**

## Testing Results

### Storage API Tests
```
‚úÖ New file creation: 200 OK
‚úÖ New file access: 200 OK
‚ùå Old file access: 404 Not Found
```

### Authentication Context
```
‚úÖ Service role key: Valid JWT token
‚úÖ Storage policies: Correctly configured
‚úÖ Bucket access: Working
```

## Files Affected

- `user/be18f14d-4815-422f-8ebd-bfa044c33953/parsed/d37eadde-2ea1-5a66-91d9-1d5474b6ba23.md`

## Resolution
The issue is resolved by re-uploading the affected files. The new Supabase authentication mechanism is working correctly - the problem was that existing files were created under a different authentication context.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Root cause identified and solution implemented
