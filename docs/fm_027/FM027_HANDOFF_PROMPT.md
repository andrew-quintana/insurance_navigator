# FRACAS FM-027 Investigation Handoff

## Status: PARTIALLY RESOLVED - Additional Issues Detected

**Date**: October 1, 2025, 00:08 UTC  
**Handoff Reason**: Similar failure pattern observed after initial fixes  
**Previous Agent**: Claude (Sonnet)  
**Next Agent**: [To be assigned]

---

## Investigation Summary

### ✅ **Issues Identified and Fixed**

1. **Supabase Storage Authentication** - FIXED
   - **Problem**: Incorrect header order causing 400 Bad Request
   - **Solution**: Updated headers to match StorageManager pattern
   - **Status**: Deployed to staging (commit: `cc04c4f`)

2. **Webhook URL Configuration** - FIXED  
   - **Problem**: Hardcoded production URL for staging environment
   - **Solution**: Environment-specific URL logic + flexible env vars
   - **Status**: Deployed to staging (commit: `ea783fd`)

### ❌ **Ongoing Issue: Document Processing Still Failing**

**New Failure Observed:**
```json
{
  "job_id": "e3d2e149-ebe5-4d29-9bfa-c1875b69d319",
  "document_id": "2f064818-4568-5ca2-ad05-e26484d8f1c4", 
  "status": "failed_parse",
  "last_error": "Non-retryable error: user_facing_error: Document file is not accessible for processing. Please try uploading again. (Reference: 680dd7d3-4d1d-4cb0-a6e3-14a30c715578)",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-01T00:08:13.164830"
}
```

**Key Observations:**
- Same document ID as previous failure (`2f064818-4568-5ca2-ad05-e26484d8f1c4`)
- New job ID (`e3d2e149-ebe5-4d29-9bfa-c1875b69d319`) 
- Same error message pattern
- Timestamp: 2025-10-01T00:08:13 (after our fixes were deployed)

## Immediate Investigation Required

### 1. **Verify Deployment Status**
```bash
# Check if latest fixes are actually deployed
mcp_render_list_deploys serviceId=srv-d37dlmvfte5s73b6uq0g limit=3
mcp_render_get_deploy serviceId=srv-d37dlmvfte5s73b6uq0g deployId=[latest_deploy_id]
```

### 2. **Check Recent Worker Logs**
```bash
# Look for logs around 2025-10-01T00:08:13
mcp_render_list_logs resource=srv-d37dlmvfte5s73b6uq0g startTime=2025-10-01T00:05:00Z endTime=2025-10-01T00:10:00Z
```

**Look for:**
- Is worker using new code (check for "Using staging webhook base URL" vs "Using production default webhook base URL")
- Are storage requests still getting 400 errors?
- Any new error patterns?

### 3. **Test Storage Access Directly**
```bash
# Test the specific file that's failing
curl -H "apikey: [SERVICE_ROLE_KEY]" -H "Authorization: Bearer [SERVICE_ROLE_KEY]" "https://dfgzeastcxnoqshgyotp.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/files/user/74a635ac-4bfe-4b6e-87d2-c0f54a366fbe/raw/5796784a_5e4390c2.pdf" -v
```

### 4. **Check Environment Variables**
Verify staging worker has correct environment variables:
- `ENVIRONMENT=staging`
- `STAGING_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` (if set)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_URL`

---

## Potential Root Causes

### **A. Deployment Issue**
- New code not actually deployed
- Worker still running old version
- Environment variables not updated

### **B. Additional Storage Issue**
- File permissions changed
- Storage bucket configuration issue
- Different authentication method needed

### **C. Webhook Delivery Issue**
- Webhook URL still incorrect
- API endpoint not responding
- Authentication failure in webhook processing

### **D. File-Specific Issue**
- This particular file has issues
- File corruption or access problems
- Path resolution issue

---

## Files Modified (Previous Work)

### `backend/workers/enhanced_base_worker.py`
**Lines 1355-1360**: Storage authentication headers
```python
# FIXED: Correct header order
headers={
    "apikey": service_role_key,
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {service_role_key}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "User-Agent": "Insurance-Navigator/1.0"
}
```

**Lines 574-586**: Flexible webhook URL configuration
```python
# FIXED: Environment-specific URLs with env var support
if environment == "staging":
    base_url = os.getenv(
        "STAGING_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL", 
        "https://insurance-navigator-staging-api.onrender.com"
    )
else:
    base_url = os.getenv(
        "PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL", 
        "https://insurance-navigator-api.onrender.com"
    )
```

## Test Scripts Available

### `test_fm027_validation.py`
- Tests storage access with new headers
- Validates webhook URL generation
- Checks worker initialization

### `test_flexible_webhook_config.py`
- Tests environment variable configuration
- Validates priority hierarchy
- Documents usage examples

---

## Next Steps for Investigation

### **Immediate (High Priority)**
1. ✅ Verify latest deployment is live
2. ✅ Check worker logs for new error
3. ✅ Test storage access for failing file
4. ✅ Confirm environment variables

### **Secondary (Medium Priority)**
1. Test with a completely new document upload
2. Check if issue is file-specific or systemic
3. Verify webhook delivery to staging API
4. Check API service health

### **Tertiary (Low Priority)**
1. Review related incidents (FM-025, FM-026)
2. Analyze processing pipeline end-to-end
3. Add additional monitoring/logging

---

## Environment Details

### **Staging Services**
- **Upload Worker**: `srv-d37dlmvfte5s73b6uq0g`
- **API Service**: `srv-d3740ijuibrs738mus1g` 
- **API URL**: `https://insurance-navigator-staging-api.onrender.com`
- **Supabase URL**: `https://dfgzeastcxnoqshgyotp.supabase.co`

### **Recent Commits**
- `ea783fd`: Make webhook URLs configurable via environment variables
- `cc04c4f`: Fix document processing failures (storage auth + webhook URLs)

---

## Success Criteria

### **Investigation Complete When:**
1. ✅ Root cause of continued failures identified
2. ✅ Fix implemented and tested
3. ✅ Document processing working end-to-end
4. ✅ No user-facing errors occurring

### **Resolution Complete When:**
1. ✅ All tests passing
2. ✅ Staging deployment successful
3. ✅ Monitoring in place
4. ✅ Documentation updated

---

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Is the new code actually running?** (Check deployment status and logs)
2. **Why is the same document still failing?** (File-specific vs systemic issue)
3. **Are there additional authentication issues?** (Storage, API, or webhook)
4. **Is the webhook system working correctly?** (URL generation and delivery)

---

**Investigation Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Time**: 2-4 hours  
**Dependencies**: Render MCP, Supabase MCP access  
**Testing Requirement**: MANDATORY local testing before staging deployment

*This handoff provides complete context for continuing the FM-027 investigation. The previous work identified and fixed two critical issues, but additional problems remain that require further investigation.*
