# Main API Service Debugging - 2025-09-15 05:38

## Overview
This directory contains documentation and debugging materials for resolving the main API service startup failure in the Insurance Navigator project.

## Files
- **`rca_spec_main_api_service.md`** - Root Cause Analysis specification for the Supabase client initialization error
- **`debug_main_api_prompt.md`** - Detailed debugging prompt for another agent to resolve the issue
- **`README.md`** - This overview file

## Problem Summary
The main API service (`main.py`) fails to start with a `TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxy'` error during Supabase client initialization. This prevents the registration endpoint from working, blocking frontend user registration functionality.

## Current Service Status
- ✅ Frontend (port 3000) - Running
- ✅ Upload Pipeline API (port 8001) - Running with minor database SSL issues
- ✅ Local Supabase (port 54321) - Running
- ❌ Main API Service (port 8000) - Failing to start

## Next Steps
1. Use the RCA spec to systematically analyze the root cause
2. Follow the debug prompt to implement a solution
3. Validate that the main API service starts successfully
4. Test end-to-end user registration workflow

## Success Criteria
- Main API service starts on port 8000
- Registration endpoint works correctly
- Frontend can successfully register users
- No regression in other services
