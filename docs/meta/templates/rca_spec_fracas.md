# Root Cause Analysis Specification - FRACAS Methodology

## Overview

This specification defines how to conduct Root Cause Analysis using the FRACAS (Failure Reporting, Analysis, and Corrective Actions System) methodology. All RCA work should follow this systematic approach to ensure comprehensive failure tracking and resolution.

## FRACAS Methodology

### Core Principles

1. **Comprehensive Failure Tracking**: Document all failures, no matter how small
2. **Systematic Investigation**: Follow structured investigation process
3. **Evidence-Based Analysis**: Base conclusions on concrete evidence
4. **Continuous Learning**: Build organizational knowledge from failures
5. **Proactive Prevention**: Use failure patterns to prevent future issues

### Documentation Structure

Each initiative should maintain a single `fracas.md` document containing:
- Active failure modes (ongoing issues)
- Resolved failure modes (historical knowledge)
- Investigation guidelines and templates
- Testing scenarios and health metrics

## RCA Process

### 1. Failure Detection and Initial Documentation

When a failure is detected:

#### Immediate Actions (Within 1 hour):
- **Assign Failure Mode ID**: Use format `FM-XXX` where XXX is sequential number
- **Document Initial Symptoms**: Record what was observed
- **Assess Severity**: Classify as Low/Medium/High/Critical
- **Determine Impact**: Identify affected functionality
- **Record Context**: Environment, timing, user actions, configuration

#### Initial Documentation Template:
```markdown
### **FM-XXX: [Descriptive Failure Name]**
- **Severity**: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
- **Status**: üîç Under Investigation
- **First Observed**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Last Updated**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Symptoms:**
- [Specific observable behaviors]
- [Error messages or codes]
- [Affected functionality]

**Observations:**
- [Initial findings]
- [Patterns noticed]
- [Environmental factors]

**Investigation Notes:**
- [Steps being taken]
- [Hypotheses being explored]

**Root Cause:**
Under investigation

**Solution:**
Pending

**Related Issues:**
- [Links to related failures]
```

### 2. Systematic Investigation

#### Investigation Framework:

**2.1 Evidence Collection**
- **Logs**: System logs, error logs, application logs
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step reproduction procedures
- **Environment**: Configuration, versions, dependencies
- **Timing**: When failure occurs, frequency patterns
- **User Impact**: Who is affected, severity of impact

**2.2 Hypothesis Development**
- **Theory Formation**: Develop multiple theories about potential causes
- **Prioritization**: Rank theories by likelihood and evidence
- **Testing Strategy**: Plan how to test each theory
- **Evidence Requirements**: Define what evidence would prove/disprove each theory

**2.3 Systematic Testing**
- **Isolation Testing**: Test components in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions
- **Environmental Testing**: Test under different conditions
- **Boundary Testing**: Test edge cases and limits

### 3. Root Cause Identification

#### Root Cause Criteria:
A true root cause must satisfy:
- **Necessity**: If this cause were eliminated, the failure would not have occurred
- **Sufficiency**: This cause alone is sufficient to produce the failure
- **Evidence**: Concrete evidence supports this conclusion
- **Reproducibility**: The cause-effect relationship can be demonstrated

#### Common Root Cause Categories:
- **Configuration Issues**: Incorrect settings, missing variables
- **Integration Problems**: Service communication failures, API incompatibilities
- **Logic Errors**: Code bugs, algorithmic problems
- **Resource Issues**: Memory, CPU, storage, network limitations
- **Dependency Failures**: External service failures, library incompatibilities
- **Environmental Problems**: Infrastructure issues, deployment problems

### 4. Solution Development

#### Solution Framework:

**4.1 Immediate Actions (Temporary Fixes)**
- **Workarounds**: Temporary solutions to restore functionality
- **Risk Mitigation**: Actions to prevent further damage
- **User Communication**: Inform affected users of status

**4.2 Permanent Solutions**
- **Root Cause Elimination**: Address the fundamental cause
- **Prevention Measures**: Prevent recurrence of similar issues
- **Monitoring**: Add monitoring to detect similar issues early
- **Testing**: Verify the solution resolves the issue completely

**4.3 Implementation Planning**
- **Change Management**: Plan implementation with minimal disruption
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing before deployment
- **Rollback Plan**: Plan for reverting if solution causes new issues
- **Validation Criteria**: Define how to verify solution effectiveness

### 5. Documentation and Knowledge Capture

#### Complete Documentation Requirements:

**5.1 Investigation Record**
- **Timeline**: Chronological record of investigation steps
- **Evidence**: All collected evidence and analysis
- **Theories**: All theories explored, including those ruled out
- **Testing**: All tests performed and results

**5.2 Solution Documentation**
- **Root Cause**: Detailed explanation of the true cause
- **Solution**: Complete description of the implemented fix
- **Prevention**: Measures taken to prevent recurrence
- **Monitoring**: New monitoring or alerting implemented

**5.3 Knowledge Transfer**
- **Lessons Learned**: Key insights from the investigation
- **Process Improvements**: Changes to prevent similar issues
- **Documentation Updates**: Updates to procedures, guides, or specifications

### 6. Prevention and Monitoring

#### Proactive Measures:

**6.1 Pattern Analysis**
- **Failure Pattern Review**: Regular review of failure modes for patterns
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify increasing failure rates or new failure types
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential future failures based on patterns

**6.2 Process Improvements**
- **Development Process**: Improve development practices to prevent failures
- **Testing Process**: Enhance testing to catch issues earlier
- **Monitoring Process**: Improve monitoring and alerting systems
- **Documentation Process**: Better documentation to prevent knowledge gaps

**6.3 Continuous Learning**
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodic review of FRACAS document for insights
- **Team Knowledge Sharing**: Share learnings across team members
- **Process Evolution**: Continuously improve the FRACAS process itself

## Templates and Standards

### Severity Classification

- **Critical**: System completely unusable, data loss, security breach
- **High**: Major functionality broken, significant user impact
- **Medium**: Important functionality degraded, moderate user impact
- **Low**: Minor issues, minimal user impact

### Status Categories

- **üîç Under Investigation**: Actively being investigated
