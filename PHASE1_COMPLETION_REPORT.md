- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. Module Initialization System ✅

**Defined explicit initialization order:**
1. Database service initialization
2. Agent integration service initialization
3. System health monitoring
4. Graceful shutdown procedures

- Error handling and recovery
- Comprehensive logging

### 4. CI/CD Integration ✅

**Created automated validation pipeline:**
- Import validation script (`scripts/validate_imports.py`)
- Agent migration script (`scripts/migrate_agents_to_di.py`)
- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/phase1-import-validation.yml`)
- Comprehensive test suite (`test_phase1_imports.py`)

**Validation Coverage:**
- Circular dependency detection
- psycopg2 usage detection
- Import resolution validation
- System initialization testing

### 5. Agent System Updates ✅

**Updated BaseAgent for dependency injection:**
- Added `db_manager` and `config` parameters
- Implemented `initialize()`, `health_check()`, and `shutdown()` methods
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Enhanced error handling and logging

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Management Consolidation

**Before Phase 1:**
- Multiple database managers (`backend/shared/db/connection.py`, `api/upload_pipeline/database.py`)
- Mixed psycopg2 and asyncpg usage
- Inconsistent connection management
- No centralized health monitoring

**After Phase 1:**
- Single `core/database.py` with unified interface
- Pure asyncpg implementation for async operations
- Centralized connection pooling and health monitoring
- Environment-specific configuration management

### Agent Integration Architecture

**Before Phase 1:**
- Direct imports causing circular dependencies
- No centralized agent management
- Inconsistent initialization patterns
- Limited error handling and monitoring

**After Phase 1:**
- Centralized `AgentIntegrationManager` with dependency injection
- Explicit agent lifecycle management
- Comprehensive health monitoring
- Graceful error handling and recovery

### Import Management Resolution

**Before Phase 1:**
- 99 import errors detected across 137 files
- Circular dependencies in agents directory
- psycopg2 compatibility issues
- No import validation in CI/CD

**After Phase 1:**
- Core modules import successfully
- Zero circular dependencies in core system
- psycopg2 usage eliminated from core/agents
- Automated import validation in CI/CD pipeline
