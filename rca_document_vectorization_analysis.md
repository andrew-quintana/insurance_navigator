**üîç INVESTIGATE CONNECTION HEALTH:**
- [ ] **API Endpoints**
  - Are document upload endpoints responding?
  - Is authentication working properly?
  - Are CORS issues preventing uploads?
  - What is the error rate for API calls?

- [ ] **Data Flow**
  - Can users see their uploaded documents?
  - Are processing status updates working?
  - Is there proper feedback for failed uploads?
  - How are permissions handled for document access?

## üõ†Ô∏è **DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS**

### Database Investigation
```sql
-- Check document and vector table status
SELECT table_name, row_count 
FROM (
  SELECT 'documents' as table_name, COUNT(*) as row_count FROM documents
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'vectors' as table_name, COUNT(*) as row_count FROM vectors
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'regulatory_documents' as table_name, COUNT(*) as row_count FROM regulatory_documents
) t;

-- Check for orphaned records
SELECT 
  d.id,
  d.filename,
  d.upload_date,
  v.id as vector_id,
  v.created_at as vector_created
FROM documents d
LEFT JOIN vectors v ON d.id = v.document_id
WHERE v.id IS NULL;

-- Check processing job status
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM job_queue 
GROUP BY status;
```

### Function Testing
```bash
# Test edge functions individually
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/doc-parser \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": true}'

# Check function logs
supabase functions logs --function-name doc-parser

# Verify environment variables
supabase secrets list
```

### Vector Search Testing
```sql
-- Test vector similarity search
SELECT 
  d.filename,
  d.content_preview,
  v.embedding <-> '[your_test_vector]' as similarity
