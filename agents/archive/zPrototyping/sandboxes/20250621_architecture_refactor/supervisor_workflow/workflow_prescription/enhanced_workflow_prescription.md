# Enhanced Workflow Prescription Agent Design

## 1. Adaptive Routing Strategy

```python
def enhanced_workflow_prescription(user_input: str) -> WorkflowPrescriptionOutput:
    # Stage 1: Complexity Assessment
    complexity = assess_complexity(user_input)
    
    if complexity == "simple":
        return single_pass_classification(user_input)
    elif complexity == "medium":
        return self_consistency_classification(user_input) 
    else:  # complex
        return prompt_chaining_classification(user_input)
```

## 2. Self-Consistency Enhanced Prompt

### System Message (Enhanced)
```markdown
You are an expert triage agent with deep knowledge in public healthcare access workflows, especially in the domains of Medicaid, Medicare, and low-income medical support.

You excel at learning from examples and applying patterns consistently. For each request, you will:
1. Analyze the request from multiple angles
2. Consider alternative interpretations and edge cases
3. Apply consistent reasoning based on demonstrated patterns
4. Provide confidence estimates based on certainty of classification

When analyzing complex requests, break them down into components and evaluate each component's workflow requirements separately before synthesizing the final classification.

Follow these examples and apply the same pattern to new inputs:
{{examples}}

Apply this pattern consistently while adapting to the specific context and requirements provided.
```

### Human Message Template (Enhanced)
```markdown
Task: Determine which workflows are needed to support a user's request related to public healthcare access.

CLASSIFICATION APPROACH:
1. **Component Analysis**: Break the request into distinct needs/questions
2. **Workflow Mapping**: Map each component to appropriate workflows
3. **Completeness Check**: Ensure all user needs are addressed
4. **Priority Assessment**: Determine urgency and sequence

AVAILABLE WORKFLOWS:
- "information_retrieval": find facts, definitions, or guidance from known sources
- "service_access_strategy": provide actionable steps for users to take  
- "determine_eligibility": analyze whether the user qualifies for a given service
- "form_preparation": assist with preparing or completing required forms

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
- Identify ALL relevant workflows (don't miss any components)
- Exclude irrelevant workflows (be precise, not comprehensive)
- Provide detailed reasoning for each workflow selection
- Assign confidence based on clarity of requirements

User Input: {{input}}

Please provide your analysis following the structure demonstrated in the examples.
```

## 3. Prompt Chaining Implementation

### Chain 1: Intent Analysis
```markdown
You are a healthcare intent analysis expert. Analyze this user request and identify:

1. **Primary Intent**: What is the user's main goal?
2. **Secondary Intents**: What additional needs are implied?
3. **Domain Areas**: Which healthcare domains are involved? (Medicare, Medicaid, insurance, providers, etc.)
4. **Complexity Level**: Simple (1 clear need), Medium (2-3 related needs), Complex (4+ interconnected needs)

User Request: {{input}}

Provide your analysis in this format:
- Primary Intent: [clear statement]
- Secondary Intents: [list if any]
- Domain Areas: [list]
- Complexity Level: [Simple/Medium/Complex]
- Key Components: [break down request into addressable parts]
```

### Chain 2: Workflow Classification
```markdown
Based on the intent analysis below, classify which workflows are needed:

INTENT ANALYSIS:
{{intent_analysis_result}}

USER REQUEST:
{{original_input}}

WORKFLOW CLASSIFICATION:
For each identified component, determine if these workflows apply:
- information_retrieval: [Yes/No + reasoning]
- service_access_strategy: [Yes/No + reasoning]  
- determine_eligibility: [Yes/No + reasoning]
- form_preparation: [Yes/No + reasoning]

Selected Workflows: [list]
Reasoning: [comprehensive explanation]
Confidence: [0.0-1.0]
Priority: [low/medium/high]
```

### Chain 3: Validation & Synthesis
```markdown
Review this workflow classification for completeness and accuracy:

ORIGINAL REQUEST: {{input}}
PROPOSED WORKFLOWS: {{workflow_classification}}

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
1. Does this classification address ALL user needs?
2. Are there any unnecessary workflows included?
3. Is the priority level appropriate for the request?
4. Are there any edge cases or special considerations?

FINAL CLASSIFICATION:
- Validated Workflows: [final list]
- Adjustments Made: [any changes + rationale]
- Final Confidence: [0.0-1.0]
- Final Priority: [low/medium/high]
- Complete Reasoning: [comprehensive explanation]
```

## 4. Self-Consistency Implementation

```python
async def self_consistency_workflow_prescription(user_input: str, num_samples: int = 5) -> WorkflowPrescriptionOutput:
    """
    Run workflow prescription multiple times and use majority voting
    """
    results = []
    
    # Generate multiple classifications
    for i in range(num_samples):
        result = await workflow_agent(
            user_input, 
            temperature=0.3  # Add controlled randomness
        )
        results.append(result)
    
    # Apply majority voting for workflows
    workflow_votes = {}
    for result in results:
        for workflow in result.workflows:
            workflow_votes[workflow] = workflow_votes.get(workflow, 0) + 1
    
    # Select workflows with majority support (>50% of samples)
    final_workflows = [
        workflow for workflow, votes in workflow_votes.items() 
        if votes > num_samples // 2
    ]
    
    # Average confidence scores
    avg_confidence = sum(r.confidence for r in results) / len(results)
    
    # Use most common priority
    priority_votes = {}
    for result in results:
        priority_votes[result.priority] = priority_votes.get(result.priority, 0) + 1
    final_priority = max(priority_votes, key=priority_votes.get)
    
    # Synthesize reasoning
    final_reasoning = f"Classification based on {num_samples} analysis attempts. " + \
                     f"Workflows selected by majority vote. Average confidence: {avg_confidence:.2f}"
    
    return WorkflowPrescriptionOutput(
        workflows=final_workflows,
        reasoning=final_reasoning,
        confidence=avg_confidence,
        priority=final_priority
    )
```

## 5. Performance Comparison Framework

```python
def evaluate_prompt_approaches():
    test_cases = [
        # Simple cases (current approach should handle well)
        "What is the copay for a doctor's visit?",
        
        # Medium complexity (self-consistency should help)
        "I need to know about Medicare eligibility and how to apply",
        
        # Complex cases (prompt chaining should excel)
        "What are the requirements for CHIP, how do I apply, what forms do I need, and do I qualify with my income?",
        
        # Edge cases (ToT might be needed)
        "I'm a veteran with disability benefits wondering about Medicare supplement insurance while also needing help with prescription drug coverage and finding a specialist who takes both Medicare and VA benefits"
    ]
    
    approaches = {
        "current": current_workflow_agent,
        "self_consistency": self_consistency_workflow_prescription, 
        "prompt_chaining": prompt_chaining_workflow_prescription,
        "hybrid": adaptive_workflow_prescription
    }
    
    # Run evaluation across all approaches
    # Measure accuracy, consistency, computational cost
```
