# Architecture & Agent Prototype Sandboxes

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploring and prototyping system architectures, agent behaviors, and workflow patterns. These notebooks complement the main `langgraph_demo.ipynb` in the parent directory, which serves as the primary reference for LangGraph patterns.

Based on the Jupyter notebook management documentation from [Earth Data Science](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/open-reproducible-science/jupyter-python/manage-directories-jupyter-dashboard/), these notebooks serve as interactive testing environments for specific system components and architectural experiments.

## Current Notebooks

### ðŸŽ¯ **`agent_orchestrator_prototype.ipynb`** - Multi-Agent Coordination
**Purpose**: Prototyping agent orchestration patterns and coordination mechanisms

**Contents**:
- Multi-agent workflow coordination
- State management across different agents
- Routing logic and decision trees
- Integration patterns for complex agent interactions

**Use Cases**:
- Testing new orchestration patterns
- Validating agent communication protocols
- Debugging multi-agent workflows

### ðŸ‘‘ **`supervisor_architecture_prototype.ipynb`** - Hierarchical Agent Patterns
**Purpose**: Exploring supervisor-based agent architectures and hierarchical control patterns

**Contents**:
- Supervisor-agent communication patterns
- Hierarchical task distribution
- Resource allocation strategies
- Escalation and delegation mechanisms

**Architecture Focus**:
- Top-down control structures
- Agent capability matching
- Load balancing and resource optimization

## Relationship to Main Demo

The notebooks in this directory build upon the foundational patterns demonstrated in `../langgraph_demo.ipynb`. While the main demo shows proper LangGraph usage patterns, these sandbox notebooks explore specific architectural approaches and experimental implementations.

**Recommended Learning Path**:
1. Start with `../langgraph_demo.ipynb` for LangGraph fundamentals
2. Explore sandbox notebooks for specific architectural patterns
3. Create new sandbox notebooks for your experimental work

## Usage Guidelines

### Creating New Sandbox Notebooks

When creating new prototype notebooks:

1. **Use descriptive naming**: `{component}_{purpose}_prototype.ipynb`
2. **Include clear purpose statement** in the first markdown cell
3. **Document key findings** and architectural decisions
4. **Reference parent utilities** from `../langgraph_utils.py`
5. **Add proper error handling** for robust experimentation

### Notebook Organization

Follow this structure for consistency:

```markdown
# {Notebook Title} - {Brief Purpose}

## Purpose
Clear statement of what this notebook explores

## Architecture Overview  
High-level description of the patterns being tested

## Implementation
Code cells with detailed explanations

## Key Findings
Document important discoveries and decisions

## Next Steps
Areas for future exploration or integration
```

### Integration Testing

Use these notebooks to:

- **Validate new patterns** before main codebase integration
- **Test edge cases** and error conditions
- **Document architectural decisions** with working examples
- **Prototype complex workflows** before production implementation

## Dependencies

All notebooks require:

```bash
pip install langgraph langchain-core langchain-community
pip install pydantic typing-extensions
pip install jupyter notebook
```

## File Management

Following [Jupyter file management best practices](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/4076):

- **Rename notebooks** using the Jupyter dashboard checkbox + rename
- **Move notebooks** using the dashboard move functionality  
- **Delete outdated prototypes** carefully (deletes all contents)
- **Create subdirectories** as needed for organization

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Use proper imports without conditional checks
- Implement TypedDict schemas for LangGraph states
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Add logging for debugging complex workflows

### Documentation
- Clear markdown explanations between code cells
- Architecture diagrams where helpful
- Decision rationale for design choices
- Links to relevant external documentation

### Experimentation
- Test edge cases and failure modes
- Compare different implementation approaches
- Measure performance implications
- Document lessons learned

## Integration Path

Successful prototypes should follow this integration path:

1. **Sandbox Testing** - Validate concepts in isolation
2. **Component Integration** - Test with existing system components
3. **Documentation Update** - Record architectural decisions
4. **Main Codebase Integration** - Implement in production system
5. **Archive Prototype** - Keep as reference documentation
