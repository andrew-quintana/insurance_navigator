    - Insurance Provider: Standard and experimental coverage policies
    - Healthcare Provider: Treatment recommendations and documentation
    - Regulatory Bodies: Treatment approval status
    ```

- **resource_constraints**: Available resources and limitations
  - Example:
    ```
    - Financial: Limited to $X budget
    - Time: Strategy needed within Y weeks
    - Personnel: Z available staff members
