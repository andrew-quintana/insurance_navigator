### Core Components

#### 1. **SupervisorWorkflowState (TypedDict)**
- Proper LangGraph state schema following production patterns
- Comprehensive state management for agent outputs and metadata
- Error handling and step tracking throughout workflow execution

#### 2. **SupervisorTeamWorkflow Class**
- LangGraph StateGraph implementation with async execution
- Four nodes: workflow_prescription → document_requirements → document_availability → deterministic_router
- Follows `agent_orchestrator.py` patterns from production codebase

#### 3. **Agent Integration**
- **Workflow Prescription Agent**: Classifies user requests into workflows using ReAct methodology
- **Document Requirements Agent**: Maps workflows to required documents using RAG search
- **Document Availability Agent**: Checks Supabase storage using systematic ReAct document search

#### 4. **Deterministic Router**
- Four routing outcomes based on document availability and quality
- Clear decision logic with confidence thresholds
- Production-ready error handling and edge case management

## Key Features

## Technical Implementation

### State Schema Design
```python
class SupervisorWorkflowState(TypedDict):
    # Core workflow data
    user_input: str
    user_id: str
    workflow_id: str
    
    # Agent outputs
    workflow_prescription: dict
    document_requirements: dict
    document_availability: dict
    
    # Routing decisions
    routing_decision: str
    final_recommendation: dict
    
    # Metadata and error handling
    metadata: dict
    error: str
    step_results: dict
```

### Workflow Compilation Pattern
```python
# Build LangGraph workflow
self.graph = StateGraph(SupervisorWorkflowState)
self.graph.add_node("workflow_prescription", self._workflow_prescription_node)
self.graph.add_node("document_requirements", self._document_requirements_node)
self.graph.add_node("document_availability", self._document_availability_node)
self.graph.add_node("deterministic_router", self._deterministic_router_node)

# Linear chain with final routing
self.graph.add_edge("workflow_prescription", "document_requirements")
self.graph.add_edge("document_requirements", "document_availability")
self.graph.add_edge("document_availability", "deterministic_router")
self.graph.add_edge("deterministic_router", END)

# Compile for execution
self.compiled_workflow = self.graph.compile()
```

### Deterministic Routing Logic
```python
if overall_readiness == "ready_to_proceed" and confidence >= 0.8:
    decision = RoutingDecision.PROCEED
elif overall_readiness == "needs_documents" and missing_docs:
    decision = RoutingDecision.COLLECT
elif overall_readiness == "needs_document_updates" or quality_issues:
    decision = RoutingDecision.UPDATE
elif confidence < 0.5:
    decision = RoutingDecision.REVIEW
else:
    decision = RoutingDecision.REVIEW  # Default fallback
```
