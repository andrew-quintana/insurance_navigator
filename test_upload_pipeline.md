# Test Document for Upload Pipeline

This is a test document to verify the complete upload pipeline functionality.

## Key Features to Test:
1. File upload to blob storage
2. Document parsing (even with mock service)
3. Webhook processing
4. Database updates

## Expected Results:
- File should be stored in Supabase storage
- Document should be processed and chunks created
- Job status should progress through stages

This document contains enough content to generate meaningful chunks for testing the embedding and search functionality.
