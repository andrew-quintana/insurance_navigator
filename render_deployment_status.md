## 🚨 Required Actions

### 1. Deploy Latest main.py to Render

The unified API implementation exists in your local `main.py` but hasn't been deployed to Render yet.

**Deployment Options:**

#### Option A: Git-based Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Commit the unified API changes
git add main.py
git commit -m "feat: Add unified API for regulatory document processing"

# 2. Push to main branch (triggers auto-deploy if configured)
git push origin main
```

#### Option B: Manual Deployment via Render Dashboard
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Find your service: `insurance-navigator-api`
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"

### 2. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Test the unified endpoints after deployment
python test_render_unified_api.py
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If deployment fails, check:
1. **Build logs** in Render dashboard
2. **Environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Dependencies** in requirements.txt are up to date
4. **Database connections** are working

Once deployed, you'll have:
- ✅ Unified API for all document types
- ✅ Regulatory document processing via URLs
- ✅ Vector generation for semantic search
- ✅ Consistent processing pipeline
- ✅ Enhanced chat capabilities with regulatory context
