# DEPRECATED: Local Job Processing Script
# 
# This script is no longer needed - we now use Supabase Cron for automatic job processing
# 
# The job processing is handled automatically by Supabase cron jobs that run every minute
# See PHASE1_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md for details
#
# Active Supabase Cron Jobs:
# - process-document-jobs: Runs every minute (* * * * *)
# - cleanup-old-jobs: Runs daily at 2 AM (0 2 * * *)
#
# To monitor: Check cron.job and cron.job_run_details tables in your database
