# Production Issue Report - Live Testing Results

**Testing Date:** June 13, 2025  
**Environment:** ***REMOVED***  
**Tester:** Manual testing with users `deploymenttest@example.com` and `databaserefactor@example.com`

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND**

### ❌ **Issue #1: PyPDF2 Import Error** 
**Status:** 🔧 FIXED & DEPLOYED  
**Severity:** HIGH - Blocking core functionality

**Problem:**
```
NameError: name 'PyPDF2' is not defined
```

**Impact:** Document upload completely broken - users cannot upload PDF files

**Root Cause:** PyPDF2 import was commented out in main.py during refactoring but the extraction function still tries to use it

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# OLD (broken):
# import PyPDF2  # REMOVED - using LlamaCloud

# NEW (fixed):
import PyPDF2  # Required for PDF text extraction
```

**Commit:** `2dd7672` - "🐛 HOTFIX: Re-enable PyPDF2 import"  
**Deployment:** Pushed to staging - Render will auto-deploy

### ⚠️ **Issue #2: Missing /upload-document-backend Endpoint**
**Status:** 🔍 INVESTIGATION NEEDED  
**Severity:** MEDIUM - UI fallback works

**Problem:**
```
405 Method Not Allowed: /upload-document-backend
```

**Impact:** Frontend tries new endpoint first, falls back to `/upload-policy`

**Analysis:** The UI is looking for `/upload-document-backend` which doesn't exist in our API. This suggests:
1. Frontend expects a different endpoint name than what we implemented
2. Need to either add this endpoint or update frontend

## ✅ **WORKING FUNCTIONALITY**

### 🟢 **Authentication System**
- ✅ User registration working (`databaserefactor@example.com` created successfully)
- ✅ User login working (`deploymenttest@example.com` logged in)
- ✅ JWT token generation and validation working
- ✅ `/me` endpoint returning user info correctly

### 🟢 **Core API Endpoints**
- ✅ `/health` endpoint responding (200 OK)
- ✅ `/` root endpoint working
- ✅ API version 2.0.0 being reported
- ✅ CORS headers working properly

### 🟢 **Database Operations**
- ✅ User creation and storage working
- ✅ User role assignment working (default 'user' role)
- ✅ Database connections stable

## 📊 **TESTING RESULTS SUMMARY**

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Authentication | ✅ PASS | Registration & login working |
| Database | ✅ PASS | User operations successful |
| API Health | ✅ PASS | All core endpoints responding |
| Document Upload | ❌ FAIL | PyPDF2 import error (FIXED) |
| PDF Processing | ⏳ PENDING | Needs retest after fix deployment |
| Frontend Integration | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Endpoint mismatch needs investigation |

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN**

1. **✅ FIXED:** Re-enabled PyPDF2 import in main.py
2. **✅ DEPLOYED:** Pushed fix to staging branch
3. **⏳ MONITORING:** Waiting for Render auto-deployment

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS**

### **High Priority** (Do Immediately)
1. **Monitor Render deployment** - Verify fix is deployed
2. **Retest document upload** - Try uploading PDF after deployment 
3. **Investigate endpoint mismatch** - Check why UI expects `/upload-document-backend`

### **Medium Priority** (Next 24 hours)
4. **Run comprehensive manual tests** - Use `MANUAL_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`
5. **Test database refactoring features** - Verify hybrid search working
6. **Performance validation** - Check if <50ms policy lookups are achieved

### **Low Priority** (This week)
7. **Complete migration** - Apply database schema changes in production
8. **Monitor system stability** - Watch logs for additional issues

## 🏁 **PRODUCTION READINESS ASSESSMENT**

**Current Status:** 🟡 MOSTLY READY
- Core functionality: ✅ Working
- Authentication: ✅ Working  
- Document upload: 🔧 Fixed, pending deployment
- Database refactoring: ⏳ Pending migration execution

**Recommendation:** Wait for current fix deployment, then proceed with final testing before production migration.
